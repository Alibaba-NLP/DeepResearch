# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: Where can I use Tongyi DeepResearch?

A: (1) **Local deployment:** You can follow the instructions in the [README](README.md#quick-start) to deploy the agent model locally.
(2) **Production service:** For a production-ready service, visit [bailian](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/?spm=a2ty02.31808181.d_app-market.1.6c4974a1tFmoFc&tab=app#/app/app-market/deep-search/) and follow the guided setup.

### Q: Do you plan to release the training data?

A: We don’t plan to release the training data, but we have open-sourced the methods for synthesizing it in our series of papers.

### Q: Do you plan to release the Heavy Mode?

A: We’ve already open-sourced the code for ReAct inference in our papers. The Heavy Mode is not fully open-sourced yet, but we plan to release it in the future.

### Q: Why can I not reproduce the results in the paper?

A: The agent model was trained using specific prompts and tools. To reproduce the results, please make sure you’re using the same prompts and tools released in the codebase. We’re also working on developing a more general agent model.
