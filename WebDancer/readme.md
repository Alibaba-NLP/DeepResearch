## ðŸ•º Introduction

- We propose **WebDancer**, a novel end-to-end agentic training framework designed to enhance the multi-step information-seeking capabilities of web-based agents.
- We introduce a four-stage training paradigm comprising **browsing data construction, trajectory sampling, supervised fine-tuning for effective cold start, and reinforcement learning for improved generalization**, enabling the agent to autonomously acquire robust search and reasoning skills.
- Our data-centric approach integrates trajectory-level supervision and online learning to develop a scalable pipeline for **training agentic systems**.
- We instantiate this framework in a ReAct-based agent and conduct extensive experiments on **GAIA** and **WebWalkerQA** benchmarks. Results demonstrate that WebDancer achieves strong performance across diverse tasks, validating the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm and providing systematic insights for future agent development.
