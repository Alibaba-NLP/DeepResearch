Introduction & Objective: Treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) may attenuate the progression of renal disease and cardiovascular events but their real-world impact on healthcare utilization and mortality in this population are not well-defined. This study aims to compare outcomes following initiation of GLP1-RA vs Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i), as active comparators, in patients with diabetes and advanced CKD.
 Methods: Retrospective cohort study using data from Veterans Health Administration during fiscal years 2006 to 2021. Inclusion criteria included U.S. veterans aged 35 years or older with advanced CKD who filled either GLP1-RA or DPP4i prescriptions. The primary outcome was acute healthcare utilization. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and acute cardiovascular events (not including death).
 Results: The eligible cohort included 26,997 GLP1-RA users and 37,708 DPP4 users. After propensity score matching (16,076 pairs) and 2.2 years mean follow-up duration, use of GLP1-RA was associated with lower annual rate of acute healthcare utilization (coefficient of regression β = -0.15, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.05, p=0.004) and lower all-cause mortality as compared to the DPP4i group (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.89, p<0.01) with time-to- death analysis showing a HR of 0.86 (95%CI: 0.82-0.90, p <0.001). There was no significant difference in cardiovascular events between groups (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06, p=0.66). Conclusions: Use of GLP1-RA in patients with advanced CKD was associated with lower annual rate of acute healthcare utilization and decreased all-cause mortality. There was no significant difference in cardiovascular events between the matched groups.

BACKGROUND
Data on the effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on pancreatic cancer incidence are limited and inconsistent. Here we evaluate the association of GLP-1RAs, alone and in combinations, with incident pancreatic cancer risk in a real-world population, stratified by obesity and smoking status.


METHODS
This retrospective cohort included patients with T2DM who were prescribed GLP-1RAs or other non-GLP-1RA anti-diabetes medications between January 2013 and March 2019 and had no prior diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The incident (first-time) diagnosis of pancreatic cancer during a 5-year follow-up was compared between propensity-score matched cohorts of patients prescribed GLP-1RAs vs other non-GLP-1RA anti-diabetes medications. Subgroup analyses were performed in patients stratified by the status of obesity and tobacco use disorder. We also compared GLP-1RA combination therapies with monotherapies. Time-to-first-event analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, with the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated.


RESULTS
The study population comprised 1,636,056 eligible patients including 167,091 prescribed GLP-1RAs and 1,468,965 prescribed other anti-diabetes medications. GLP-1RAs were associated with a significantly decreased risk for pancreatic cancer incidence compared with each of six non-GLP-1RA anti-diabetes medications with HR ranging from 0.42 to 0.82. The reduction was greater in patients with obesity and tobacco use disorder than in those without. GLP-1RA combination therapies were associated with lower pancreatic cancer risk compared with monotherapies.


CONCLUSIONS
GLP-1RAs were associated with reduced pancreatic cancer incidence in patients with T2DM. Further studies and trials are needed to explore mechanisms and confirm causal effects.

Background: Diabetes affects millions of people worldwide annually, and several methods, including medications, are used for its management; glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are one such class of medications. The efficacy and safety of GLP-1RAs in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have been assessed and have been shown to significantly improve time in range (TIR) in several clinical trials. However, presently, there is a lack of real-world evidence on the efficacy of GLP-1RAs in improving TIR. To address this, we investigated the effect of GLP-1RA-based treatment strategies on TIR among patients with T2DM in real-world clinical practice. Methods: This multicenter, retrospective, real-world study included patients with T2DM who had previously used a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system and received treatment with GLP-1RAs or oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Patients who received OADs served as controls and were matched in a 1:1 ratio to their GLP-1RA counterparts by propensity score matching. The primary endpoint was the TIR after 3–6 months of treatment. Results: According to propensity score matching, 202 patients were equally divided between the GLP-1RA and OAD groups. After 3–6 months of treatment, the TIR values for the GLP-1RA and OAD groups were 76.0% and 65.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). The GLP-1RA group displayed significantly lower time above range (TAR) and mean glucose values than the OAD group (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that, compared with the administration of liraglutide, the administration of semaglutide and polyethylene glycol loxenatide (PEG-Loxe) significantly improved TIR over 3–6 months of treatment (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These real-world findings indicate that GLP-1RA-based treatment strategies could be superior to oral treatment strategies for improving TIR among patients with T2DM and that once-weekly GLP-1RA may be more effective than a once-daily GLP-1RA.

Introduction In type 2 diabetes (T2D), key barriers to optimal glycaemic control include lack of persistence with treatment, reduced medication adherence and therapeutic inertia. This study aimed to assess the impact of these barriers in obese adults with type 2 diabetes treated with a GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) and compare them against other glucose-lowering agents in a real-world setting. Methods A retrospective study was conducted using electronic medical records from 2014 to 2019 for adults with T2D at the Valencia Clínico-Malvarrosa Department of Health (Valencia, Spain). Four study groups were established: all GLP-1RA users, SGLT2i users, insulin users and other glucose-lowering agent users (miscellany group). To account for imbalance between groups, propensity score matching (PSM) including age, gender and pre-existing cardiovascular disease was performed. Chi-square tests were used for comparisons between groups. Time to first intensification was calculated using competing risk analysis. Results Among the 26,944 adults with T2D, 7392 individuals were selected following PSM, with 1848 patients in each group. At 2 years, GLP-1RA users were less persistent than non-users (48.4% versus 72.7%, p  < 0.0001) but more adherent (73.8% versus 68.9%, respectively, p  < 0.0001). A greater proportion of persistent GLP-1RA users than non-persistent users exhibited reduced HbA1c (40.5% versus 18.6%, respectively, p  < 0.0001), but no differences in cardiovascular outcomes and death were found. Overall, therapeutic inertia was observed in 38.0% of the study population. The large majority of GLP-1RA users received treatment intensification, whereas only 50.0% of GLP-1RA non-users were intensified. Conclusion Under real-life conditions, obese adults with T2D persistently treated with GLP-1RA showed improved glycaemic control. Despite benefits, persistence with GLP-1RA was limited after 2 years. Additionally, therapeutic inertia occurred in two out of three study participants. Strategies to facilitate medication adherence, persistence and treatment intensification in people with T2D should be made a priority in order to achieve and maintain glycaemic targets and improve outcomes in this population. Trail registration Study registered in clinicaltrials.org with the identifier NCT05535322.

ABSTRACT Background Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that Songling Xuemaikang capsule (SXC) is effective in blood pressure (BP) lowering for essential hypertension. However, the effectiveness of SXC in real-world clinical practice remains unknown. We aimed to investigate whether the BP-lowering effectiveness of SXC in the real-world practice setting is comparable to the efficacy of the intervention in a randomized controlled trial. Methods We included 1325 patients treated with SXC monotherapy from a real-world registry and 300 from the SXC-BP trial. A propensity score matching (PSM) approach was used to select participants from the two cohorts. The primary outcome was a change in the office of BP from baseline to 8 weeks. Results After PSM, there were 552 patients for the comparative analysis. Clinically meaningful BP reductions were observed both in the real world and in the RCT cohorts after 8-week SXC treatment. The 8-week systolic/diastolic BP was 129.50/81.33 mm Hg vs. 134.97/84.14 mm Hg in the real-world population and the RCT population, respectively. The changes in systolic BP (15.82 ± 10.71 vs. 10.48 ± 10.24; P < .001), and diastolic BP (10.01 ± 7.73 vs. 7.75 ± 8.14; P = .001) from baseline to 8 weeks were significantly greater in the real-world population. Conclusion The current comparison demonstrated that SXC monotherapy is at least as effective in real-world settings as within the randomized controlled trial for BP lowering in patients with grade 1 hypertension.

Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia with societal and economic burdens. While recent therapies offer disease-modifying potential, concerns remain about efficacy and safety. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), used in type 2 diabetes, show neuroprotective effects via reduced neuroinflammation and amyloid burden. Objective To evaluate whether GLP-1RA use is associated with a reduced risk of incident dementia in adults aged ≥50 years using real-world data. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX platform, analyzing records from 142 healthcare organizations. Adults aged ≥50 were included, comparing GLP-1RA users (liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, albiglutide) to non-users. Propensity-score matching balanced demographics and comorbidities. Incident dementia, defined by ICD-10 codes, was analyzed with Cox proportional-hazards models. Results Matched cohorts (n = 147,505 each) had similar baseline characteristics. Dementia incidence was lower in GLP-1RA users (0.20% versus 0.44%), with a hazard ratio of 0.30 (95% CI 0.28–0.33; p < 0.001). Conclusions GLP-1RA use was associated with a 70% reduced dementia risk, warranting further clinical evaluation.

Background: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy combined with immunotherapy (NICRT) is a new neoadjuvant treatment approach that has raised concerns regarding potential challenges in surgery and postoperative complications. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) and NICRT for the treatment of resectable locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 291 patients with locally advanced ESCC who underwent neoadjuvant therapy and esophagectomy at three centers between January 2019 and September 2023 and added the data from PALACE-1 for the analysis, Among these patients, 248 and 61 patients received NCRT and NICRT, respectively. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance the potential bias. Results: After the PSM,the rate of a pathological complete response (pCR) in the NCRT group was not significantly different from that in the NICRT group (46.90% vs 36.36%, P = 0.180). There were no significant differences in the tumor regression grade (TRG) and positive lymph node pCR rates between the two groups (P = 0.233 and P = 0.354, respectively). Treatment-related toxicities and postoperative complications were not significantly different between the NCRT group and the NICRT group (P = 0.199, P = 0.284). Conclusion: Compared with NCRT, NICRT did not lead to the better treatment efficacy. There were no significant differences was observed in the incidence of treatment-related toxicities and postoperative complications.
