Background Gallbladder disease (GBD) can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, GBD has rarely been reported in the less developed, rural areas of Xinjiang. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of GBD and incidence of CVD in a prospective cohort study in rural Xinjiang. Moreover, the study aimed to explore the association between GBD and CVD within this cohort. Methods The study cohort included 11,444 Uyghur adults in Xinjiang, 3^rd division, from the 51st Mission. Study groups were classified according to whether GBD was present or absent at baseline. The occurrence of CVD was the end event. Demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical data were recorded, and the incidence of CVD in the GBD and non-GBD groups analysed. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association between GBD and CVD and factors associated with their incidence. Several subgroup analyses were performed to assess CVD incidence in different subgroups. The interaction between GBD and cardiometabolic risk factors, and subsequent risk of developing CVD, was evaluated. Results Prevalence of GBD in the study cohort was 10.29%. After a median follow-up of 4.92 years, the cumulative incidence of CVD in the study cohort was 10.49%, 8.43% in males and 12.65% in females. CVD incidence was higher in the GBD group (34.04% vs. 7.78%, HR = 4.96, 95% CI: 4.40–5.59). After multivariate adjustment, the risk of CVD remained higher in the GBD group (HR = 2.89, 95% CI: 2.54–3.29). Subgroup analyses showed male sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, lack of exercise, and abnormal renal function were all associated with increased risk of CVD. Moreover, the risk of CVD was markedly higher in GBD combined with cardiometabolic risk factors (hypertension, T2DM, dyslipidaemia, overweight, and abdominal obesity), than in cardiometabolic risk factors alone and this was higher in the GBD group than in the non-GBD group regardless of whether cardiometabolic risk factors were combined. Conclusion GBD is an important independent risk factor for CVD development. Awareness of these associations will raise concerns among clinicians about the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with GBD.

Background The telemedicine clinic for follow up after minor surgical procedures in general surgery is now ubiquitously considered a standard of care. However, this method of consultation is not the mainstay for preoperative assessment and counselling of patients for common surgical procedures such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of assessing and counselling patients in the telemedicine clinic without a physical encounter for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who were booked for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for benign gallbladder disease via general surgery telemedicine clinics from March 2020 to November 2021. The primary outcome was the cancellation rate on the day of surgery. The secondary outcomes were complication and readmission rates, with Clavein-Dindo grade III or greater deemed clinically significant. We performed a subgroup analysis on the cases cancelled on the day of surgery in an attempt to identify key reasons for cancellation following virtual clinic assessment. Results We identified 206 cases booked for laparoscopic cholecystectomy from telemedicine clinics. 7% of patients had a cancellation on the day of surgery. Only one such cancellation was deemed avoidable as it may have been prevented by a face-to-face assessment. Severe postoperative adverse events (equal to or greater than Clavien-Dindo grade III) were observed in 1% of patients, and required re-intervention. 30-day readmission rate was 11%. Conclusions Our series showed that it is safe and feasible to assess and counsel patients for laparoscopic cholecystectomy remotely with a minimal cancellation rate on the day of operation. Further work is needed to understand the effect of remote consultations on patient satisfaction, its environmental impact, and possible benefits to healthcare economics to support its routine use in general surgery.

Tirzepatide, a dual agonist of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors, has shown promise in improving metabolic and cardiovascular profiles in patients with obesity. However, its potential benefits in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remain unclear. We conducted a real-world, retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX global database. A total of 14,154 patients with HFpEF were included after 1:1 propensity score matching. Tirzepatide use was associated with significantly lower risks of the primary composite outcome of heart failure exacerbation and all-cause mortality (HR 0.52), as well as reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events (HR 0.64) and major adverse kidney events (HR 0.44). Subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent benefits across different strata. Sensitivity analyses using alternative exposure definitions confirmed the robustness of the findings. These results support the potential clinical utility of tirzepatide in HFpEF management and warrant further investigation in randomized controlled trials.

Aims Cancer is a well-known risk factor of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Some cancers are believed to be more thrombogenic. The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of patients with incident gastrointestinal cancers (GI) and their associated 1-year risk and timing of venous thromboembolic events and the 1-year mortality. Methods This study was a retrospective cohort study. Through Danish nationwide registries, all patients with first-time GI cancer diagnosis from 2008 to 2018 were identified. Incident VTE events were identified within a 1-year follow-up after GI cancer diagnosis using the Aalen-Johansen estimator. Cox proportional-hazard models were applied to investigate risk factors for VTE events and the impact of VTE on mortality. Results A total of 87 069 patients were included and stratified by cancer types: liver (5.8%), pancreatic (12.0%), gastric (6.9%), small intestinal (1.9%), colorectal (61.8%), oesophageal (7.3%) and gallbladder (3%). Most VTE events happened close to onset of the cancer diagnosis with declining events by time. The 1-year cumulative incidence of VTE differed according to cancer type with pancreatic cancer being most thrombogenic (7.8%), and colorectal and liver cancer being the least (3.6%). Prior VTE, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), liver disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes increased the VTE risk. Overall, the patients with GI cancer had high 1-year mortality of 33.3% with patients with pancreatic cancer having the highest mortality (70.3%). Conclusion We found that most VTE events happen close to onset of the GI cancer diagnosis and thrombogenicity differed by type of GI cancer, ranging from 7.8% in patients with pancreatic cancer to 3.6% in colorectal and patients with liver cancer. Prior VTE, heart failure, COPD, liver disease, CKD and DM were associated with increased risk of VTE.

Abstract Context Tirzepatide is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in May 2022 for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Objective We aimed to determine the rates of individual adverse events (AEs) related to 3 studied doses of tirzepatide. Methods We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis including 5 databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science) for all clinical trials reporting AEs related to tirzepatide. The safety data from individual studies were extracted and analyzed through meta-regression to assess rates of individual AEs. Study quality assessment was performed using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Results Ten trials (6836 participants) were included. Gastrointestinal (GI) AEs were the most commonly reported AEs and were dose dependent 39% (95% CI, 35%-43%), 46% (95% CI, 42%-49%), and 49% (95% CI, 38%-60%) for the 5, 10, and 15 mg dose, respectively. Among all GI AEs, nausea and diarrhea were most frequent at any dose of tirzepatide. Drug discontinuation due to AEs was highest with the 15 mg dose of tirzepatide (10%). Incidence of mild hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 70 mg/dL) was highest with tirzepatide 10 mg dose 22.6% (9.2%-39.8%). Rates of fatal AEs, severe hypoglycemia, acute pancreatitis, cholelithiasis, and cholecystitis were extremely low (≤ 1%) across all doses of tirzepatide. Conclusion Tirzepatide is associated with a dose-dependent increase in incidence of GI AEs and AEs leading to drug discontinuation. Severe hypoglycemia, fatal AEs, acute pancreatitis, cholelithiasis, and cholecystitis are rare with this medication.

Abstract Background and study aims Cholecystectomy is the standard treatment for acute cholecystitis, but it may not be suitable for all patients. For those who cannot undergo surgery, a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube (PCT) and ERCP-guided transpapillary gallbladder drainage are viable options. We aimed to perform a nationwide study to assess 30-day readmission rates, adverse events (AEs), and mortality rates in these two cohorts. Patients and methods We conducted a nationwide cohort study using data from the Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) from 2016 to 2019. We identified patients with acute cholecystitis during the index admission who underwent either PCT or ERCP-guided gallbladder drainage. Propensity score matching along with multivariable regression was used to compare cohorts. Results During the study period, 3,592 patients (average age 63.0 years) underwent endoscopic drainage, whereas 80,372 patients (average 70.8 years) underwent Interventional Radiology drainage. Utilizing multivariate Cox regression analysis, compared with ERCP, PCT had a higher risk for 30-day readmission (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27 to 1.71; P < 0.001). The PCT group had a significantly higher rate of readmission for acute cholecystitis compared with the ERCP group (2.72% vs 0.86%; P < 0.005). Cox proportional hazard ratio showed a 3.41-fold increased risk (95% CI 1.99 to 5.84) for readmission in the PCT group. ERCP was consistently associated with lower rates of post-procedural AEs compared with PCT including acute hypoxemic respiratory failure ( P < 0.001), acute renal failure ( P < 0.001), shock ( P < 0.001), and need for blood transfusions ( P < 0.001). Conclusions Our nationwide analysis revealed that ERCP-guided gallbladder drainage should be the preferred approach for managing acute cholecystitis when unfit for surgery.

Introduction To investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of tirzepatide in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods In this phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose study, patients were randomized into one of two cohorts to receive once-weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide or placebo. The initial tirzepatide dose in both cohorts was 2.5 mg, which was increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maximum final dose of 10.0 mg at week 16 (Cohort 1) or 15.0 mg at week 24 (Cohort 2). The primary outcome was the safety and tolerability of tirzepatide. Results Twenty-four patients were randomized (tirzepatide 2.5–10.0 mg: n = 10, tirzepatide 2.5–15.0 mg: n = 10, placebo: n = 4); 22 completed the study. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) among patients receiving tirzepatide were diarrhea and decreased appetite; most TEAEs were mild and resolved spontaneously with no serious adverse events reported in the tirzepatide groups and one in the placebo group. The plasma concentration half-life of tirzepatide was approximately 5–6 days. Mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) decreased over time from baseline in the 2.5–10.0 mg (− 2.4%) and 2.5–15.0 mg (− 1.6%) tirzepatide groups, at week 16 and week 24, respectively, but remained steady in patients receiving placebo. Body weight decreased from baseline by − 4.2 kg at week 16 in the tirzepatide 2.5–10.0 mg group and by − 6.7 kg at week 24 in the 2.5–15.0 mg group. Mean fasting plasma glucose levels fell from baseline by − 4.6 mmol/L in the tirzepatide 2.5–10.0 mg group at week 16 and by − 3.7 mmol/L at week 24 in the tirzepatide 2.5–15.0 mg group. Conclusions Tirzepatide was well tolerated in this population of Chinese patients with T2D. The safety, tolerability, PK, and PD profile of tirzepatide support once-weekly dosing in this population.
