Rationale: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (liraglutide, semaglutide) and dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GLP-1/GIP) receptor agonists (tirzepatide) are approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Objective: To compare the relative efficacy of tirzepatide, liraglutide, and semaglutide in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and T2D. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis in a large global federated database of patients with OSA and T2D. Two cohorts were generated, both with a treatment arm of patients prescribed tirzepatide. Liraglutide and semaglutide-treated patients provided the reference arms in cohort 1 and cohort 2, respectively. Cohorts underwent propensity-score matching at a 1:1 ratio for confounders. We examined rates of incident MACEs (composite outcome and individual components) over an 18-month follow up, and performed stratified analyses by body mass index, age, sex, and ethnicity. Finally, we assessed incident OSA in a secondary analysis of patients with T2D treated with tirzepatide compared with liraglutide and semaglutide. Results: After matching, each treatment arm included 7,836 patients in cohort 1 and 7,394 patients in cohort 2. Tirzepatide reduced the risk of incident MACEs compared with liraglutide (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.66) and semaglutide (0.86; 0.74-0.99). Tirzepatide was more efficacious in younger, male patients of White ethnicity. Moreover, tirzepatide reduced incident OSA compared with liraglutide (0.89; 0.82-0.97) but not semaglutide (0.94; 0.86-1.02). Conclusions: In patients with OSA and T2D, tirzepatide is associated with a lower incidence of MACEs compared with liraglutide and semaglutide. More robust randomized, controlled evidence is needed for these drugs in patients who are at such high risk.

Abstract Aims In this first interim analysis of the SCORE study, we investigated the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and overweight/obesity but without diabetes who initiated semaglutide 2.4 mg in real‐world settings. Materials and Methods Individuals initiating semaglutide 2.4 mg aged ≥45 years with ASCVD and overweight/obesity but without diabetes were identified in a US database (01/01/2016–12/31/2023) and matched 1:2 to those not on semaglutide based on a non‐parsimonious propensity‐score model. The primary outcomes included revised 3‐point MACE (rMACE‐3: myocardial infarction, stroke, and all‐cause mortality) and revised 5‐point MACE (rMACE‐5: rMACE‐3, coronary revascularisation, and hospitalisation for heart failure). Secondary outcomes included MACE‐3 and MACE‐5, defined similarly to rMACE‐3 and rMACE‐5 but replacing all‐cause mortality with cardiovascular‐related mortality. Exploratory outcomes included incident type 2 diabetes, major adverse kidney events, and major obesity‐related adverse events. Results A total of 9321 individuals on semaglutide 2.4 mg were matched to 18,642 individuals not on semaglutide; patient characteristics were well‐balanced between cohorts. Over a mean follow‐up of 200 days, semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with significantly lower risks of rMACE‐5 (hazard ratio: 0.55; p < 0.001), rMACE‐3 (0.43; p < 0.001), MACE‐5 (0.65; p < 0.001), and MACE‐3 (0.58; p < 0.01). Semaglutide 2.4 mg was also associated with lower risks of all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular‐related mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure, and all exploratory outcomes. Conclusions In this real‐world study of US individuals with ASCVD and overweight/obesity but without diabetes, semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with significantly reduced risk of MACEs and other obesity‐related morbidities (NCT06874751).

Introduction Semaglutide is a high-profile glucose-lowering drug that medical decision-makers have acknowledged in recent years. This rapid review aims to provide evidence-based clinical recommendations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with semaglutide. Methods We conducted a rapid review of randomized controlled trial (RCT)-based meta-analyses (MAs) and systematic reviews (SRs) of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) compared to other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) or placebo in patients with T2DM. Prospective cohort real-world studies (RWS) were also retrieved and subjected to MA. Four databases, including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and ISPOR, were searched from inception to 5 March 2023. The outcomes of interest were hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), body weight, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and economic outcomes such as quality-adjusted life-years and total cost. Results We identified 33 publications: 22 RCT-based MAs, 1 SR of CEAs, and 10 RWS. Evidence showed that semaglutide at usual doses was associated with superior reductions in HbA1c and weight compared to most GLP-1 RAs in patients with T2DM who were drug naive, receiving basal insulin, or using oral hypoglycemic agents, and it was also associated with a lower number of MACE and was more cost-effective. Further, once-weekly semaglutide resulted in a significant reduction in HbA1c levels (−1.1%) and body weight (−4.88 kg) in routine clinical practice. Conclusions This review consolidates the positive current evidence base for prescribing semaglutide to patients with T2DM, but further rigorous studies are still urgently required to develop practice guidelines as innovative drugs become commercially available.

When compared with placebo, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists such as once-weekly semaglutide (semaglutide OW T2D) improve cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), whereas dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) do not. However, no head-to-head trials of these 2 incretin-based drug classes have been conducted. This retrospective cohort study used 2018-2022 data from the Optum

 Data Mart to compare on-treatment time with incidence of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and 2-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; composite of ischemic stroke and MI); health care resource utilization; and medical costs in new adult users of semaglutide OW T2D and DPP-4is with T2D and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients were followed until drug discontinuation, enrollment end, or an event. Baseline characteristics (

 ) were balanced using inverse probability of treatment weighting. On average, patients were aged 70 years, with 5.6- and 4.3-year history of T2D and ASCVD, respectively. Survival analyses were conducted to compare risks during exposure. Users of semaglutide OW T2D (weighted n=14,461) had 46%, 36%, and 40% lower relative risk of ischemic stroke, MI, and 2-point MACE, respectively, compared with users of DPP-4is (weighted n=38,630; all

Abstract Introduction: Increasing interest in real-world evidence has fueled the development of study designs incorporating real-world data (RWD). Using the Causal Roadmap, we specify three designs to evaluate the difference in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) with oral semaglutide versus standard-of-care: (1) the actual sequence of non-inferiority and superiority randomized controlled trials (RCTs), (2) a single RCT, and (3) a hybrid randomized-external data study. Methods: The hybrid design considers integration of the PIONEER 6 RCT with RWD controls using the experiment-selector cross-validated targeted maximum likelihood estimator. We evaluate 95% confidence interval coverage, power, and average patient time during which participants would be precluded from receiving a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1-RA) for each design using simulations. Finally, we estimate the effect of oral semaglutide on MACE for the hybrid PIONEER 6-RWD analysis. Results: In simulations, Designs 1 and 2 performed similarly. The tradeoff between decreased coverage and patient time without the possibility of a GLP1-RA for Designs 1 and 3 depended on the simulated bias. In real data analysis using Design 3, external controls were integrated in 84% of cross-validation folds, resulting in an estimated risk difference of –1.53%-points (95% CI –2.75%-points to –0.30%-points). Conclusions: The Causal Roadmap helps investigators to minimize potential bias in studies using RWD and to quantify tradeoffs between study designs. The simulation results help to interpret the level of evidence provided by the real data analysis in support of the superiority of oral semaglutide versus standard-of-care for cardiovascular risk reduction.

Introduction:
 Semaglutide (2.4 mg) and liraglutide (3.0 mg) are glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) drugs used to promote weight loss, with evidence indicating a greater effect for semaglutide. In the SELECT trial, semaglutide reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular disease (CVD) events compared to placebo among overweight or obese individuals without diabetes. Both semaglutide and liraglutide are effective at improving glycemic control, though no clinical trials have assessed incident diabetes as a primary endpoint.
 
 
 Hypothesis:
 Among patients without diabetes, semaglutide is associated with lower risk of incident CVD and diabetes compared with liraglutide.
 
 
 Methods:
 Using the MarketScan insurance claims database from 2020-22, we matched diabetes-free patients prescribed semaglutide with up to 2 controls prescribed liraglutide by age, sex, enrollment date and prescription date. We used Cox regression to assess the association of semaglutide versus liraglutide use with incident 1) diabetes, 2) hard CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke and heart failure), and 3) a composite outcome of hard CVD plus unstable angina and coronary revascularization. Models adjusted for age, sex, and a propensity score determined by comorbidities and the use of other medications.
 
 
 Results:
 Our sample included 15,017 semaglutide users and 21,431 matched liraglutide users who initiated treatment during 2021 or 2022 (mean age 45 years; 83% female). Follow-up concluded at the end of 2022 or insurance disenrollment. Over a mean of 0.7 years, there were 631 diabetes, 30 hard CVD, and 64 composite CVD events. Comparing semaglutide with liraglutide, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) was 0.60 (0.35-1.02) for the composite CVD outcome and 0.57 (0.26-1.25) for hard CVD. The proportional hazards assumption was violated in the analysis of diabetes (p=0.01). Semaglutide use was associated with higher risk of diabetes during the first six months of follow-up (2.07 [1.70-2.53]) and lower risk thereafter (0.70 [0.54-0.92]).
 
 
 Conclusions:
 In this real-world study of GLP-1 RAs and CVD outcomes, results directionally favored semaglutide over liraglutide. The change in directionality of the association with incident diabetes may be supported by the results of the SUSTAIN 10 and PIONEER 4 trials, which showed a greater improvement in measures of glycemic control for liraglutide during early follow-up visits, but a superior effect of semaglutide by the end of the trial.

Background: Semaglutide is a recently approved glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. Several trials reported the protective effect of injectable semaglutide on cardiovascular (CV) risk by reducing major adverse cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetes patients. Strong preclinical evidence supports the CV benefits of semaglutide through an effect on atherosclerosis. However, scant evidence is available about the protective mechanisms of semaglutide in clinical practice. Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted among consecutive type 2 diabetes patients treated with injectable semaglutide in Italy between November 2019 and January 2021 when the drug was first available in the country. The primary aims were the assessment of the carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. The secondary aims were the evaluation of anthropometric, glycemic, and hepatic parameters and plasma lipids, including the assessment of the triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein ratio as an indirect marker of atherogenic small, dense low-density lipoprotein particles. Results: Injectable semaglutide reduced HbA1c and cIMT. An improvement in CV risk factors and the triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein ratio was reported. Moreover, through correlation analyses, we found that hepatic fibrosis and steatosis indices and the anthropometric, hepatic, and glycemic parameters, as well as plasma lipids, were unrelated to the variations in cIMT and HbA1c. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the effect of injectable semaglutide on atherosclerosis as a key CV protective mechanism. Considering the favorable effects on atherogenic lipoproteins and hepatic steatosis indices, our results support the pleiotropic effect of semaglutide beyond glycemic control.

Recent cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have reshaped the therapeutic landscape of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), revealing that certain glucose-lowering agents, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), offer substantial cardiovascular benefits beyond glycemic control. Injectable GLP-1RAs, such as semaglutide and liraglutide, have been shown to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), but barriers, including cost, access, and the burden of injections, persist. The SOUL trial marks a significant milestone by evaluating oral semaglutide in high-risk patients, demonstrating a 14% reduction in MACE versus placebo and reinforcing GLP-1RAs cardioprotective potential in an oral formulation. This advancement holds promise for patient populations underrepresented in prior trials. However, gastrointestinal side effects and strict dosing requirements challenge long-term adherence. While the findings suggest improved accessibility and real-world applicability, further comparative trials with injectables, extended follow-up, and cost-effectiveness studies are essential. As evidence evolves, oral GLP-1RAs may represent a more patient-centered approach to managing diabetes and cardiovascular risk. This perspective article aims to explore the implications of the SOUL trial, highlight ongoing challenges in adherence and implementation, and discuss the future role of oral GLP-1RAs in cardiovascular and diabetes care.
