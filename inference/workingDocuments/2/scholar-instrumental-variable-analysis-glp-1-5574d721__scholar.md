Introduction and Objective: GLP-1 agonists improve blood glucose (BG) and weight in adults with T2D or obesity alongside diet and exercise. Dario Health, a digital health platform, may help identify users likely to adhere to GLP-1 treatment and advance lifestyle interventions to facilitate smooth discontinuation of GLP-1 maintaining positive clinical outcomes. The study aimed to investigate survey outcomes conducted on Dario users who have ever taken GLP-1.
 Methods: This study utilized a survey conducted among Dario users in November 2024 to gather insights into their GLP-1 usage, identify users who had used GLP-1 and evaluate their clinical outcomes, engagement and behavioral change. Chi-square, t-tests, linear mixed-effects models, and simple slope analysis were employed to assess group differences and clinical outcomes over time.
 Results: A group of 715 users reported having used GLP-1; 15% (108/715) reported discontinuation while 85% (607/715) continued and are currently taking GLP-1. A significantly higher proportion in the continued cohort reported taking GLP-1 for >6 months than in the discontinued group (χ²(3)=56.3;p<.001). In the continued cohort, lifestyle digital activities (meal and physical activity logging) significantly moderated the reduction in monthly average BG over time (p<.01); Monthly weight measurements and engagement with educational content moderated the reduction in monthly average weight (p=.02 and p<.001). In the discontinued cohort, monthly average BG and weight remained stable over the past 6 months [BG p=.11; Weight p=.65], statistically equivalent to the continued during the same period [BG p=.35; Weight p=.30].
 Conclusion: The results demonstrate the potential of a digital health platform to navigate users to continue their GLP-1 treatment, drive behavioral change and sustain weight loss and BG levels following discontinuation of GLP-1 therapy.

Introduction & Objective: Multiple clinical trials have shown cardiovascular benefits from glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study describes persistence and adherence of once weekly (OW) GLP-1 RAs use by patients with T2D and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in a real-world setting.
 Methods: The study used data from the Optum Research Database from 01 Jan 2017 through 28 Feb 2023 and identified adult patients with T2D and ASCVD with ≥1 pharmacy claim for OW GLP-1 RAs. The date of the first claim was the index date and the start of a variable follow up period. Persistence was defined as the number of days from the index date to either discontinuation of OW GLP-1 RAs or end of variable follow up. Percentages of persistent patients (those without discontinuation) were reported at 6, 12, and 18 months, as well as over the full variable follow up period. Adherence, measured as proportion of days covered (PDC) over the full variable follow up period, was reported for patients with at least 6, 12, and 18 months of follow up.
 Results: Among a total of 29516 patients, the mean follow up duration was 535 days and mean persistence was 371 days; 63.9% of patients were persistent throughout their variable follow up period. Basic demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between persistent and non-persistent patients. At 6 months, 80.2% of patients were persistent; the percentage was 63.2% and 54.3% at 12 and 18 months, respectively. PDC was 0.72, 0.68, and 0.66 among patients with at least 6, 12, or 18 months of follow up, respectively.
 Conclusions: Patients had at least two-thirds of PDC and 63.9% of them were persistent throughout their follow up. Identifying factors influencing persistence and adherence is imperative to guide interventions aimed at enhancing these aspects, thereby maximizing the cardiovascular benefits derived from GLP-1 RAs.

We assessed the effect of active follow-ups on viral load (VL) suppression among people living with HIV (PLWH) who had missed their clinic visit(s) and were receiving intensive adherence counseling (IAC) at a large referral hospital in mid-western Uganda. We designed a quasi-experimental study, using a locator map (a local map showing residence) as an external factor (instrumental variable) that influenced active follow-up. We performed instrumental variable analysis. Of the 165 participants included, 24.8% had a client locator map, and possessing a map was associated with active follow-up (F-statistics 53.1; P <0.0001). Active follow-up did not significantly improve VL suppression at varying cutoffs, namely <1,000 copies/ml (P = 0.607), less than 200 copies/ml (P = 0.684), and less than 50 copies/ml (P = 0.435). Although active follow-up did not significantly improve VL suppression among PLWH on IAC, it showed a modest trend toward improvement. Large, randomized trials are needed.

Introduction In type 2 diabetes (T2D), key barriers to optimal glycaemic control include lack of persistence with treatment, reduced medication adherence and therapeutic inertia. This study aimed to assess the impact of these barriers in obese adults with type 2 diabetes treated with a GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) and compare them against other glucose-lowering agents in a real-world setting. Methods A retrospective study was conducted using electronic medical records from 2014 to 2019 for adults with T2D at the Valencia Clínico-Malvarrosa Department of Health (Valencia, Spain). Four study groups were established: all GLP-1RA users, SGLT2i users, insulin users and other glucose-lowering agent users (miscellany group). To account for imbalance between groups, propensity score matching (PSM) including age, gender and pre-existing cardiovascular disease was performed. Chi-square tests were used for comparisons between groups. Time to first intensification was calculated using competing risk analysis. Results Among the 26,944 adults with T2D, 7392 individuals were selected following PSM, with 1848 patients in each group. At 2 years, GLP-1RA users were less persistent than non-users (48.4% versus 72.7%, p  < 0.0001) but more adherent (73.8% versus 68.9%, respectively, p  < 0.0001). A greater proportion of persistent GLP-1RA users than non-persistent users exhibited reduced HbA1c (40.5% versus 18.6%, respectively, p  < 0.0001), but no differences in cardiovascular outcomes and death were found. Overall, therapeutic inertia was observed in 38.0% of the study population. The large majority of GLP-1RA users received treatment intensification, whereas only 50.0% of GLP-1RA non-users were intensified. Conclusion Under real-life conditions, obese adults with T2D persistently treated with GLP-1RA showed improved glycaemic control. Despite benefits, persistence with GLP-1RA was limited after 2 years. Additionally, therapeutic inertia occurred in two out of three study participants. Strategies to facilitate medication adherence, persistence and treatment intensification in people with T2D should be made a priority in order to achieve and maintain glycaemic targets and improve outcomes in this population.

Suboptimal medication adherence has been associated with increased resource utilisation and mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) are becoming increasingly important in the treatment of T2D. However, medications in this class differ considerably in their dosing frequency, which may impact adherence. We sought to perform a meta‐analysis to compare adherence to injectable GLP‐1RAs dosed once weekly vs once daily in patients with T2D.

RATIONALE
Early identification of ICU patients likely to benefit from specialist palliative care could reduce the time such patients spend in the ICU receiving care inconsistent with their goals.


OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the real-world effects of early screening for palliative care criteria in a medical ICU.


METHODS
We performed a retrospective cohort study in adults admitted to the ICU using a causal inference approach with instrumental variable analysis. The intervention consisted of screening ICU admissions for palliative care trigger conditions, and if present, offering specialist palliative care consultation which could be accepted/declined by the ICU. We evaluated specialist palliative care use in pre- and post-implementation cohorts from the year before/after screening implementation began (October 2022). In the post-implementation cohort, we compared use of specialist palliative care in those who received early screening versus not. We then estimated the effect of early screening on the primary outcome of days to do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status or ICU discharge, with death without a DNR order placed at the 99th percentile of the days to DNR or ICU discharge distribution. Secondary outcomes included: DNR order, ICU/hospital lengths of stay, hospice discharge, and mortality metrics. To address unmeasured confounding, we used two-stage least-squares instrumental variables analysis. The instrument, which predicts early screening, comprised weekend vs. weekday admission and number of patients meeting palliative care criteria on a patient's ICU days 1 and 2.


RESULTS
Amongst 1282 post-implementation admissions, 626 (45%) received early screening, and 398 (28%) received specialty palliative consultation. Early receipt of specialist palliative care was higher in patients who received early screening vs. not (17% vs 1% , p<0.001), and overall use of specialty palliative care was higher post- vs. pre-screening implementation (28 vs. 15%, p<0.001). In the post-implementation cohort, there were no statistically significant effects of early screening on the primary outcome of days to DNR or ICU discharge (15% relative increase, 95% CI [-11% to +48%]) or other secondary outcomes.


CONCLUSIONS
Despite significantly increased specialty palliative care consultation there was no evidence that early screening for palliative care criteria affected time to DNR/ICU discharge or other secondary outcomes.

Introduction Overweight and obesity are major global health issues, increasing disease risk and straining healthcare systems. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are effective for weight loss but cause gastrointestinal side effects, affecting adherence. Research often focuses on diabetics, leaving a gap in understanding their effects on non-diabetic individuals with overweight or obesity. This systematic review and dose-response network meta-analysis addresses this gap, analyzing gastrointestinal adverse events from GLP-1 RAs in non-diabetic subjects with overweight or obesity. Methods We evaluated available evidence by searching PubMed and EMBASE databases, according to specific inclusion and exclusion eligibility criteria to evaluate gastrointestinal adverse events associated with GLP-1 RAs in non-diabetic individuals with overweight or obesity. Quality assessment of included studies was conducted using Cochrane Collaboration’s tool. Results Thirty-nine articles were included in the review showing a total number of 33,354 individuals. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation were the most common gastrointestinal adverse effects. All evaluated GLP-1 RAs led to a significant increase in nausea risk, with orforglipron showing the highest risk, followed by exenatide, tirzepatide, semaglutide, and liraglutide. Additionally, liraglutide, orforglipron, semaglutide, and tirzepatide were associated with increased vomiting risk, while cagrilinitide and exenatide showed no significant increase. Exenatide, cagrilinitide, orforglipron were not associated with diarrhea risk. Finally, semaglutide and liraglutide were associated to increased constipation risk, while cagrilinitide and exenatide showed no significant increase. Conclusions GLP-1 RAs showed several adverse gastrointestinal effects in non-diabetic patients with overweight or obesity. Understanding the different risk profiles of GLP-1 RAs helps clinicians make informed treatment decisions by balancing therapeutic benefits with potential side effects.

Simple Summary An association between individual levels of indigenous Chilean Mapuche ancestry and the risk of gallbladder cancer has been reported in observational studies, and the current program for gallbladder prevention in Chile takes the number of Mapuche surnames into account for prophylactic cholecystectomy. However, the association between Mapuche ancestry and gallbladder cancer could be due to known and unknown confounders (e.g., overweight and obesity) and non-random measurement errors (e.g., socio-economic level and access to health care). To investigate whether Mapuche ancestry and gallbladder cancer risk are statistically correlated or causally related, we used ancestry-informative markers for instrumental variable analysis. We aim to provide robust evidence on the potential of accounting for ethnic differences (in this study, Mapuche ancestry) for disease interception (in this study, gallbladder cancer prevention through prophylactic cholecystectomy). The methodology used and the results obtained may also guide future admixture mapping studies. Abstract A strong association between the proportion of indigenous South American Mapuche ancestry and the risk of gallbladder cancer (GBC) has been reported in observational studies. Chileans show the highest incidence of GBC worldwide, and the Mapuche are the largest indigenous people in Chile. We set out to assess the confounding-free effect of the individual proportion of Mapuche ancestry on GBC risk and to investigate the mediating effects of gallstone disease and body mass index (BMI) on this association. Genetic markers of Mapuche ancestry were selected based on the informativeness for assignment measure, and then used as instrumental variables in two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses and complementary sensitivity analyses. Results suggested a putatively causal effect of Mapuche ancestry on GBC risk (inverse variance-weighted (IVW) risk increase of 0.8% per 1% increase in Mapuche ancestry proportion, 95% CI 0.4% to 1.2%, p = 6.7 × 10−5) and also on gallstone disease (3.6% IVW risk increase, 95% CI 3.1% to 4.0%), pointing to a mediating effect of gallstones on the association between Mapuche ancestry and GBC. In contrast, the proportion of Mapuche ancestry showed a negative effect on BMI (IVW estimate −0.006 kg/m2, 95% CI −0.009 to −0.003). The results presented here may have significant implications for GBC prevention and are important for future admixture mapping studies. Given that the association between the individual proportion of Mapuche ancestry and GBC risk previously noted in observational studies appears to be free of confounding, primary and secondary prevention strategies that consider genetic ancestry could be particularly efficient.

Instrumental variable analysis (IVA) has been widely used in many fields, including health care, to determine the comparative effectiveness of a treatment, intervention, or policy. However, its application in pediatric end-of-life care research has been limited. This article provides a brief overview of IVA and its assumptions. It illustrates the use of IVA by investigating the comparative effectiveness of concurrent versus standard hospice care for reducing 1-day hospice enrollments. Concurrent hospice care is a relatively recent type of care enabled by the Affordable Care Act in 2010 for children enrolled in the Medicaid program and allows for receiving life-prolonging medical treatment concurrently with hospice care. The IVA was conducted using observational data from 18,152 pediatric patients enrolled in hospice between 2011 and 2013. The results indicated that enrollment in concurrent hospice care reduced 1-day enrollment by 19.3%.
