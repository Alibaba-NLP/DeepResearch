Tirzepatide is a novel drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic weight management, and there is an urgent need to explore its safety profile. The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database provides a reliable pathway for adverse event (AE) disproportionality analysis. Data regarding AEs registered in the FAERS between Q2 2022 and Q4 2023 were collected for this study. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) method was applied to analyse the association between tirzepatide use and the risk of developing AEs. The occurrence of ≥3 AEs with an ROR value 95% confidence interval (CI) lower limit >1 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Data on 638,153 AEs were collected from the FAERS database, and tirzepatide use was implicated for 8,096 of those AEs. A total of 98 preferred terms (PTs) were detected as positive signals for tirzepatide use. Frequently observed expected AEs included injection site pain, nausea, injection site haemorrhage, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Some unexpected AEs that were frequently observed included incorrect doses, off-label use, the administration of extra doses, an inappropriate schedule of product administration, and increased blood glucose. In this study, we identified potential novel and unexpected AE signals associated with tirzepatide use. Our findings confirm the importance of real-world disproportionality analysis in identifying the safety profile of new drugs, ultimately contributing to the safe clinical application of tirzepatide.

Background Tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, is indicated for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. However, the safety profile of Tirzepatide-associated adverse events requires comprehensive evaluation. Methods The AE reports from the first quarter of 2022 to the third quarter of 2023 were selected by exploring the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. The new and unexpected potenial AE signals were detected using the disproportionality analysis, including reporting odds ratio(ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) and the empirical Bayes geometric mean(EBGM). Then the MedDRA was used to systematically classify the results. Results A total of 1,904,481 case reports were obtained from 2022Q2 to 2023Q3. Forty-sixth tirzepatide-induced ADRs at the preferred terms (PTs) level are associated with 8 system organ class In addition, this study uncovered multiple anticipated ADRs, such as gastrooesophageal reflux disease, dyspepsia, and vomiting, in line with the drug labels. Moreover, unexpected and significant ADRs at PTs level, such as incorrect dose administered, injection site haemorrhage, and increased appetite, were discovered and linked to Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications, General disorders and administration site conditions, and Metabolism and nutrition disorders at the System Organ Class level. Conclusion This study offered new perspectives on the monitoring, surveillance, and management of adverse drug reactions related to tirzepatide. The outcomes of severe adverse events and their respective detection signals, along with unexpected significant adverse event signals, are important to consider in efforts to enhance clinical medication safety when using tirzepatide.

Objective Tirzepatide, a novel GIP and GLP1 agonist, has been extensively examined in clinical trials. However, specific data on its adverse drug events (ADEs) remain limited. This study aims to comprehensively assess real-world ADEs associated with tirzepatide by mining data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Methods ADE reports from the FAERS database were retrieved for the second quarter of 2022 through the first quarter of 2024. Significant associations between ADEs and tirzepatide were evaluated using proportional disproportionality analyses, including the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinkage (MGPS). Results A total of 37,827 ADE reports associated with tirzepatide were identified, with 100 significantly disproportionate preferred terms (PTs) recognized by all four algorithms. The top five PTs with the highest reporting rates were incorrect dose administered, injection site pain, off-label use, nausea, and injection site hemorrhage. Additionally, unexpected signals such as starvation ketoacidosis were identified. The median time to onset for all ADEs was 23 days. Furthermore, sex-specific high-intensity signals were found, with males primarily experiencing gastrointestinal disorders and females experiencing general disorders and administration site conditions. Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the occurrence of ADEs following tirzepatide administration, potentially supporting clinical monitoring and risk identification efforts.

Background: Tirzepatide (Mounjaro or Zepbound), a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist, is approved for type 2 diabetes and weight management. Despite its efficacy, real-world safety data remain limited. This study analyzed post-marketing adverse events (AEs) associated with tirzepatide using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to identify emerging safety concerns. Methods: FAERS reports from 2022 to Q1 2025 were analyzed. Disproportionality analyses (proportional reporting ratio [PRR], reporting odds ratio [ROR], empirical Bayes geometric mean [EBGM], and information component [IC]) were performed to detect safety signals. Reports were stratified by year, demographics, and AE type, focusing on cases in which tirzepatide was the primary suspect. Results: Among 65,974 reports, the majority originated from the U.S. (96%), with middle-aged females (40–59 years; 67%) most frequently affected. Incorrect dose administration was the top AE, increasing 8-fold from 1248 (2022) to 9800 (2024), with strong risk signals (ROR 22.15, 95% CI (20.75–23.65), and ROR 23.43, 95% CI (22.82–24.05), respectively, and PRR 16.80, 95% CI (15.74–17.93), and PRR 17.62, 95% CI (17.16–18.09), respectively). Other common AEs included injection-site reactions (e.g., pain [5273 cases in 2024]), gastrointestinal issues (nausea [3602 in 2024]), and off-label use. Class-related AEs (e.g., decreased appetite and blood glucose fluctuations) were also reported. Conclusions: Tirzepatide is associated with significant dosing errors, injection-site reactions, and gastrointestinal AEs in real-world use. The rising trend in reports underscores the need for enhanced provider and patient education, clearer dosing guidelines, and proactive monitoring. Further research is warranted to explore causative factors and optimize risk mitigation strategies.

Purpose of study: Residues P/K/D/N/H undergo enzymatic hydroxylations essential for proteins that, like collagens, fibrillins, collectins, and hypoxia-inducible factors, co-determine cancer outcome. Despite disparate protein substrates, these enzymes follow identical catalysis by activating inhaled O2 for hydroxylation - the HAG mechanism, formulated in a 1983 thesis. It details catalysis at subatomic resolution, classifies all possible inhibitors, identifies the first selective inhibitor of collagen and collectin biosynthesis, and defines the numerous 2-oxoacid utilizing dioxygenases (2OUDs). The HAG mechanism is considered ‘seminal’ for drug development (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7857312/). mechanism2OUDs occur in clusters. This predicts HAG inhibitors to act across polygenic hydroxylation-dependent protein families relevant in cancer. Single-drug multi-targeted inhibition is a paradigm for anticancer drug discovery (e.g. Alimta™ [https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdf/10.1200/JCO.1999.17.10.3009]). We tested multi-targeted 2OUD suppression with an FDA-approved medicine, deferiprone (DEF), that per HAG mechanism blocks 2OUD cofactors (2-oxoacid, ascorbate).
 Hypothesis: HAG mechanism blockade in multiple 2OUD-reliant pathways triggers a cascade of aftereffects; in cancer cells, this HAG sequence is lethal and immunogenic.
 Methods: Culture/metabolic labeling/RNA-seq/flow cytometry of models for high grade serous ovarian cancer (KURAMOCHI), uterine serous cancer (ARK1), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (MRC5).
 Results: In a dose-dependent manner at clinical concentrations, DEF inhibited [3H]Pro/[3H]Lys hydroxylation, not incorporation; and caused intracellular accumulation of hydroxylation-deficient collagens (COL1A1, -3A1, -6A1, -11A2, -18A1), fibrillins (FBN1), collectins (C1QA,-B, -C), and HIFs (EPAS1), exceeding controls up to 10-fold. After 96 hrs, accumulation reversed in MRC5, remained elevated in KURAMOCHI, and rose further in ARK1. Activation of the ablative unfolded protein response (UPR), via enhanced DDIT3, TRIB3, BAK1, PMAIP1, HRK expression, coincided with a >80% decline in cancer cell count. In MRC5, DEF downregulated apoptosis markers (cleaved PARP-1, active caspase 3), but upregulated both over controls in KURAMOCHI and ARK1, which also showed enhanced expression of pyroptosis markers (caspase 1, IL-18, gasdermins).
 Conclusions: DEF reactivity reveals HAG mechanism inhibition at multiple 2OUDs that hydroxylate P/K/D/N residues in cancer-relevant proteins. The ensuing HAG sequence captures the secondary effects, e.g. HIF2α-driven synthesis of underhydroxylated, therefore UPR-retained COL/FBN, triggering apoptotic cancer cell death that, due to C1q deficiency, must proceed without autoimmunity.
