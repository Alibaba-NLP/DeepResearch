Semaglutide is found to be efficient for weight loss in patients with overweight or obesity with diabetes mellitus (DM). With a wide range of adverse events reported, the efficacy and safety of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in individuals without DM, with overweight or obesity, is unclear. We conducted a comprehensive meta‐analysis of randomized studies on once‐weekly semaglutide in this patient population. We identified nine studies with 11,641 patients in the semaglutide group and 10,479 in the placebo group. We observed that semaglutide resulted in significant benefits, including change in body weight (%): mean difference (MD) of −11.49% (p < 0.0001), change in absolute body weight: MD of −11.74 kg (p < 0.0001), and change in waist circumference: MD of −9.06 cm (p < 0.0001). Gastrointestinal side effects are predominant including nausea: odds ratio (OR) of 4.06 (p < 0.0001), vomiting: OR of 4.43 (p < 0.0001), diarrhea: OR of 2.10 (p < 0.0001), constipation: OR of 2.43 (p < 0.0001), gallbladder disorders: OR of 1.26 (p = 0.010), and cholelithiasis: OR of 2.06 (p = 0.04). Serious adverse events were not statistically significant: OR of 1.06 (p = 0.82). However, the percentage of participants discontinuing due to adverse events and gastrointestinal side effects was statistically significant: ORs of 2.22 (p < 0.0001) and 3.77 (p < 0.0001), respectively. This study shows that in patients with overweight or obesity without DM, once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide can significantly decrease body weight without risk of serious adverse events when compared with a placebo. However, gastrointestinal side effects are predominant with semaglutide, which can result in medication discontinuation.

Background: Semaglutide, as an innovative weekly formulation, has attracted much attention. Nevertheless, the predominant occurrence of gastrointestinal adverse events (GIAEs) poses a noteworthy challenge linked to the use of this medication, substantially affecting its clinical applicability and the overall well-being of patients. Therefore, this systematic review aims to comprehensively discuss the GIAEs, providing a basis for clinical therapeutic decisions. Methods: We systematically searched 4 independent databases for randomized controlled trials investigating the application of semaglutide in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus. The search period spanned from the inception of the databases to December 2023. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis, employing Review Manager 5.4.1 software, to systematically analyze and evaluate potential biases. Our primary emphasis was on assessing the gastrointestinal safety profile of semaglutide. Results: The outcomes unveiled a noteworthy rise in the collective occurrence of GIAEs across all dosage groups of semaglutide in comparison with the control group (P < .05). Upon further analysis, it was observed that semaglutide showed a heightened occurrence of GIAEs in contrast to the placebo. However, statistically significant distinction was not observed when compared to the reduction of conventional doses or the transition to other types of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. Additionally, an extended treatment duration with semaglutide (>30 weeks) demonstrated an association with a certain degree of decrease in the incidence of gastrointestinal events. Funnel plot assessment for publication bias demonstrated high-quality inclusion of studies with no apparent publication bias. Conclusion: The frequency of GIAEs in using semaglutide was observed to be elevated in comparison to the control group. However, it was comparable to other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist or low-dose treatment regimens. Additionally, an extended treatment duration played a role in decreasing the frequency of GIAEs. These findings provide valuable insights for clinical practice. Nonetheless, further research is crucial to explore supplementary data indicators, informing clinical practices and better serving the interests of patients.

The broadening application of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists, specifically semaglutide (Ozempic) for the management of diabetes and obesity brings a critical need to evaluate its safety profile, considering estimates of up to 20 million prescriptions per year in the US until 2035. This systematic review aims to assess the incidence of thyroid cancer and detail the spectrum of adverse events associated with semaglutide, focusing on its implications for patient care. Through a systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases up to December 2023, ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 14,550 participants, with 7830 receiving semaglutide, were analyzed, with an additional number of 18 studies that were separately discussed because they reported data from the same RCTs. The review focused on thyroid cancer incidence, gastrointestinal symptoms, and other significant adverse events attributed to semaglutide. The incidence of thyroid cancer in semaglutide-treated patients was less than 1%, suggesting no significant risk. Adverse events were predominantly gastrointestinal, including nausea (2.05% to 19.95%) and diarrhea (1.4% to 13%). Nasopharyngitis and vomiting were also notable, with mean prevalences of 8.23% and 5.97%, respectively. Other adverse events included increased lipase levels (mean of 6.5%), headaches (mean prevalence of 7.92%), decreased appetite (reported consistently at 7%), influenza symptoms (mean prevalence of 5.23%), dyspepsia (mean prevalence of 5.18%), and constipation (mean prevalence of 6.91%). Serious adverse events varied from 7% to 25.2%, highlighting the need for vigilant patient monitoring. These findings underscore the gastrointestinal nature of semaglutide’s adverse events, which, while prevalent, did not significantly deter from its clinical benefits in the treatment landscape. This systematic review provides a comprehensive assessment of semaglutide’s safety profile, with a focus on gastrointestinal adverse events and a low incidence of thyroid cancer. Despite the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms, semaglutide remains an efficacious option for managing diabetes and obesity. The detailed characterization of adverse events underscores the importance of monitoring and managing these effects in clinical practice, excluding the hypothesis of carcinogenesis.

Semaglutide is a newly approved glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist(GLP-1 RA), significantly reducing HbA1c and body weight. However, it is associated with an increased incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events. Xiang-Sha-Liu-jun-Zi (XSLJZ), is a classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula with the effects of modulating gastrointestinal disturbance.
 This study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of the XSLJZ for treatment of Semaglutide-induced gastrointestinal side effects.
 
 
 
 This is a multicentre, randomized, open-label trial. The trial included a run-in period within 2 weeks, a 4-week treatment period, and another 4 weeks after the end of the experimental phase. Patients who have Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions during the run-in period will be randomly divided (1:1) into 2 groups. The primary outcome measures were changes in scores on the Gastrointestinal System Rating Scale(GSRS), the duration of individual gastrointestinal adverse events. The secondary outcomes were TCM syndrome score, changes in glycaemic excursions, homeostatic model assessment 2-B (HOMA2-B)and homeostatic model assessment 2-insulin resistance(HOMA2-IR), glucagon, C-peptide, plasma lipids, Anthropometric parameters: body weight, body mass index, waist-hip circumference, waist-hip ratio.
 
 
 
 The results of this trial will provide initial evidence for the use of XSLJZ as an alternative and complementary intervention to manage Semaglutide-induced gastrointestinal side effects.

Background: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are commonly used to treat obesity and diabetes but are linked to a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs). Real-world data on GLP-1 RA-related GI AEs and outcomes are limited. This study assessed GI AEs and adverse outcomes using the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: This retrospective pharmacovigilance study used the US FDA FAERS database (2007–2023). We searched GLP-1 RA medications, AEs, and adverse outcomes. Demographic, treatment indication, and AE data were collected. Descriptive analysis involved frequencies and percentages, while reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio, Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze GLP-1 RA-related GI AEs and outcomes. Results: From 2007 to 2023, a total of 187,757 AEs were reported with GLP-1 RAs, and 16,568 were GLP-1 RA-associated GI AEs in the US. Semaglutide was linked to higher odds of nausea (IC025: 0.151, βCoeff: 0.314), vomiting (IC025: 0.334, βCoeff: 0.495), and delayed gastric emptying (IC025: 0.342, βCoeff: 0.453). Exenatide was associated with pancreatitis (IC025: 0.601, βCoeff: 0.851) and death (ROR: 4.50, IC025: 1.101). Overall, semaglutide had a broader range of notable adverse effects; by comparison, dulaglutide and liraglutide use was associated with fewer significant GI AEs. Conclusions: Analysis of the FAERS data reveals that GLP-1 RAs, particularly semaglutide and exenatide, are significantly associated with specific GI AEs, such as nausea, vomiting, delayed gastric emptying, and pancreatitis. Clinicians should be aware of these potential risks to ensure optimal monitoring and patient safety. This study demonstrated the utility of pharmacovigilance data in identifying safety signals, which can inform future pharmacoepidemiological investigations to confirm causal relationships. Clinicians should be aware of these potential risks to ensure optimal monitoring and patient safety.

Background Semaglutide was approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic weight management in obesity or overweight adults. However, real-world data regarding its long-term gastrointestinal safety and tolerability in large sample population are incomplete. We evaluated semaglutide-associated gastrointestinal safety signals by data mining of the FDA pharmacovigilance database. Methods Reporting odds ratio (ROR) was employed to quantify the signals of semaglutide-related gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) from 2018 to 2022. Serious and non-serious cases were compared by Mann-Whitney U test or Chi-squared (χ2) test, and signals were prioritized using a rating scale. Results We identified 5,442 cases of semaglutide-associated gastrointestinal AEs, with 45 signals detected, ranging from a ROR025 of 1.01 (hypoaesthesia oral) to 42.03 (eructation), among which 17 AEs were identified as new and unexpected signals. Patient age (p < 0.001) and body weight (p = 0.006) rather than sex (p = 0.251) might be associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal AEs severity. Notably, the association between semaglutide and gastrointestinal disorders remained when stratified by age, body weight, sex and reporter type. One strong, 22 moderate and 22 weak clinical priority signals were defined. The median time-to-onset (TTO) for strong clinical priority signal was 23 days, while for moderate and weak, they were 6 and 7 days, respectively. All of the disproportionality signals had early failure type features, suggesting that the risk of gastrointestinal AEs occurrence gradually decreased over time. Conclusion Our study provided a deeper and broader understanding of semaglutide's gastrointestinal safety profiles, which would help healthcare professionals to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs in clinical practice.

Introduction Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have attracted much attention because of their significant hypoglycemic and weight-loss effects. Previous preparations can only be subcutaneously injected. Oral administration of GLP-1RAs semaglutide helps to broaden treatment options, but its safety in the real world still needs to be observed. This study is based on FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database to mine adverse drug events (ADE) of oral semaglutide, and provide references for the clinical safe use of this drug. Methods To analyze the signal quality of oral semaglutide, which is a drug used in the FAERS database from the third quarter of 2019 to the third quarter of 2023, we collected ADE data and performed data mining by using disproportionate analysis. Then, we standardized the data and used a variety of signal-quantification techniques, including reported odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian belief propagation neural network (BCPNN), and multiple empirical Bayesian gamma Poisson contractions (MGPS), for further analysis. Results We screened 2398 reports on the use of semaglutide tablets, involving a total of 5653 ADE. These reports were mainly submitted by consumers, and the reporting country was mainly the United States. A total of 23 system organ classes (SOC) and 93 preferred terms (PT) were mined for the signals of semaglutide tablets. The three most common SOC were gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, and investigations. At the PT level, metabolism and nutrition disorders exhibit the highest number of signals, with the top three being thyroid cyst, acute cholecystitis, and ketosis. Gastrointestinal disorders rank second, primarily involving eructation, pancreatitis, impaired gastric emptying, and regurgitation. In addition, vith nerve paralysis occurs and the signal intensity is high. Conclusions Our study provides a deeper and broader understanding of the safety of oral semaglutide. The results of the ROR, PRR, BCPNN, and MGPS algorithms exhibit high consistency, with metabolism and nutrition-related disorders having the highest number of signals. The conclusions align with the technical specifications of the product. Notably, other unexpected effects are reported, including acute cholecystitis, paralysis of the abducens nerve, and positional vertigo.

INTRODUCTION: Semaglutide and tirzepatide are newly approved glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for weight management in adults without diabetes. However, safety concerns regarding gastrointestinal (GI) adverse outcomes have been raised. This review comprehensively evaluates their GI safety profile in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Thirteen RCTs involving 26 894 obese participants without diabetes were analyzed. Pooled analysis assessed the risks for GI, biliary, hepatic, and pancreatic adverse events. RESULTS: Overall GI adverse events were 1.86 times higher with *both* agents (95% CI=1.56, 2.21), with tirzepatide showing a greater risk (RR 2.94, 95% CI=2.61, 3.32) than semaglutide (RR 1.68, 95% CI=1.46, 1.94). Semaglutide increased gallbladder-related disorders, particularly cholelithiasis, by over 2.6 times (95% CI=1.40, 4.82), while tirzepatide showed no significant biliary risk. Neither agent significantly increased hepatic or pancreatic adverse events. CONCLUSION: Compared to placebo, both Semaglutide and tirzepatide are associated with increased GI adverse outcomes, with most cases being mild. Clinicians should carefully monitor patients for potential adverse outcomes.

Introduction and Objective: No head-to-head studies compared individual glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and tirzepatide with respect to the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) events in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in clinical practice.
 Methods: Using data from a commercial health plan (2019-2024), we identified three pairwise cohorts of 1:1 propensity score-matched patients aged ≥18 years with T2D who initiated dulaglutide, subcutaneous (SQ) semaglutide, or tirzepatide, and estimated incidence rates and hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CIs for the risk of GI events (a composite of acute pancreatitis, biliary disease, bowel obstruction, gastroparesis, or severe constipation). In secondary analyses, individual GLP-1RA were compared head-to-head with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i).
 Results: Over a median follow up ranging from 5.8 to 6.8 months, the risk of GI adverse events was similar across individual GLP-1RA (SQ semaglutide vs. dulaglutide: HR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87-1.06]; tirzepatide vs. dulaglutide: HR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.77-1.20; tirzepatide vs. SQ semaglutide: HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.90-1.26]) (Table). Individual GLP-1RA were associated with an increased risk of GI adverse events compared with SGLT-2i.
 Conclusion: This study suggests that dulaglutide, SQ semaglutide, and tirzepatide have a comparable GI safety profile in adults with T2D.

Abstract Background Semaglutide is increasingly used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Ensuring the safety of this medication is crucial for its clinical use. This meta-analysis evaluates the safety profile of semaglutide across patient populations and treatment durations. Methods Randomized controlled trials assessing the safety of semaglutide vs. placebo, with specified treatment durations were identified. The primary outcome was occurrence of any cardiovascular adverse events. Secondary outcomes included sudden cardiac death, adverse events leading to death, adverse events, gastrointestinal side effects, occurrence of hypoglycemia, and new-onset neoplasm. Results A total of 23 studies met the inclusion criteria with a combined sample size of 57,911 participants. The meta-analysis revealed that the adverse event associated with semaglutide is gastrointestinal in nature (nausea and vomiting). No significant differences were observed between semaglutide and comparator groups. Conclusion Semaglutide appears to have a favorable safety profile across diverse patient populations and treatment durations, supporting its continued use in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. It is generally well-tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse events. Clinicians should be aware of these findings and monitor patients accordingly. Further long-term studies are warranted to assess the safety of semaglutide in clinical practice.
