The use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonsists (GLP-1 RA) continues to rise and is increasingly important in the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Though the use of GLP-1 RA continues to increase, persistence and adherence to therapy remains suboptimal.
 
 
 
 We aimed to assess the level of adherence and persistence to GLP-1 RA using real-world data and to investigate sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with discontinuation of GLP-1 RA therapy.
 
 
 
 In this retrospective cohort study, all first-time users of GLP-1 RA with T2DM ≥18 years from 2007-2020 were identified using the Danish registries (Figure 1A-1B). All participants had 18 months of follow-up. Medication possession ratio (MPR) was calculated by summing days of medication supply from all dispensed prescription made during the study period divided by number of days in study period. MPR ≥0.80 was used to define adherence. Discontinuation was defined as >90 days between the last day of prescription coverage and the first day of a new dispensed prescription. Adherence to GLP-1 RA therapy and the risk of discontinuing therapy was estimated at 6- and 12-months of follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with discontinuing GLP-1 RA therapy.
 
 
 
 In total, 44,343 first-time users of GLP-1 RA with T2DM were identified (mean age: 58.6 years, 42.7% female, 21.3% had cardiovascular disease, median duration of T2DM was 6.8 years, median HbA1c was 65 mmol/mol). The absolute risk of discontinuing GLP-1 RA at 6 and 12 months was 14.2% (95%CI: 13.9-14.6) and 21.4% (95%CI: 21.1-21.8), respectively (Figure 2A). Of the 9,520 (21.5%) who discontinued therapy during the 12-month follow-up, 1,947 (20.5%) occurred within the first 31 days of treatment. At 6 months, 58.5% were adherent to GLP-1 RA therapy with a median MPR of 0.84 [IQR: 0.70-0.95]. At 12 months, 61.1% were adherent to therapy with a median MPR of 0.85 [IQR: 0.71, 0.94]. In the multivariable model, low (<40 years) and high age (>75 years), lower household income, educational level, longer diabetes duration, and higher comorbidity burden were associated with a higher risk of discontinuing GLP-1 RA whereas baseline HbA1c was not (Figure 2B-2E).
 
 
 
 Approximately one in five patients discontinued therapy within 12 months and a little over 60% were adherent. Sociodemographic factors, including household income, age, and comorbidity burden were associated with risk of discontinuing GLP-1 RA therapy. Given the changing landscape of who should be treated with GLP-1 RA, the cardio-renal benefits reported in recent trials, and the ongoing trials in the field, future research into adherence and persistence to GLP-1 RA and possible interventions to improve these, are needed.

Introduction & Objective: Multiple clinical trials have shown cardiovascular benefits from glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study describes persistence and adherence of once weekly (OW) GLP-1 RAs use by patients with T2D and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in a real-world setting.
 Methods: The study used data from the Optum Research Database from 01 Jan 2017 through 28 Feb 2023 and identified adult patients with T2D and ASCVD with ≥1 pharmacy claim for OW GLP-1 RAs. The date of the first claim was the index date and the start of a variable follow up period. Persistence was defined as the number of days from the index date to either discontinuation of OW GLP-1 RAs or end of variable follow up. Percentages of persistent patients (those without discontinuation) were reported at 6, 12, and 18 months, as well as over the full variable follow up period. Adherence, measured as proportion of days covered (PDC) over the full variable follow up period, was reported for patients with at least 6, 12, and 18 months of follow up.
 Results: Among a total of 29516 patients, the mean follow up duration was 535 days and mean persistence was 371 days; 63.9% of patients were persistent throughout their variable follow up period. Basic demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between persistent and non-persistent patients. At 6 months, 80.2% of patients were persistent; the percentage was 63.2% and 54.3% at 12 and 18 months, respectively. PDC was 0.72, 0.68, and 0.66 among patients with at least 6, 12, or 18 months of follow up, respectively.
 Conclusions: Patients had at least two-thirds of PDC and 63.9% of them were persistent throughout their follow up. Identifying factors influencing persistence and adherence is imperative to guide interventions aimed at enhancing these aspects, thereby maximizing the cardiovascular benefits derived from GLP-1 RAs.

This study aimed to assess why and at what point along the care journey patients tend to discontinue a real world GLP-1 RA-supported Digital Weight-Loss Service (DWLS) for women in the UK. To achieve these objectives, a cohort of 8294 patients was retrospectively analyzed, using both descriptive statistics and correlation tests. Mean adherence to the program was 183.1 (±148.9) days and the most common reasons for discontinuation were program cost (38.7%), dissatisfaction with results (16.8%), intolerable side effects (15.4%), attainment of one’s weight-loss goal (7.3%) and temporary pause/holidays (5.6%). Patients who were older, Caucasian and overweight tended to adhere to the program for a statistically significantly longer period than their younger, non-Caucasian and higher BMI-class peers. This study provides important foundational insights to the scarce literature on real world GLP-1 RA-supported DWLSs, which are becoming increasingly popular in the obesity epidemic.

Increasingly large numbers of people are using digital weight loss services (DWLSs) to treat being overweight and obesity. Although it is widely agreed that digital modalities improve access to care in general, obesity stakeholders remain concerned that many DWLSs are not comprehensive or sustainable enough to deliver meaningful health outcomes. This study adopted a mixed methods approach to assess why and after how long patients tend to discontinue Australia’s largest DWLS, a program that combines behavioural and pharmacological therapy under the guidance of a multidisciplinary care team. We found that in a cohort of patients who commenced the Eucalyptus DWLS between January and June 2022 (n = 5604), the mean program adherence was 171.2 (±158.2) days. Inadequate supplying of a patient’s desired glucose-like peptide-1 receptor agonist medication was the most common reason for discontinuation (43.7%), followed by program cost (26.2%), result dissatisfaction (9.9%), and service dissatisfaction (7.2%). Statistical tests revealed that ethnicity and age both had a significant effect on patient adherence. These findings suggest that DWLSs have the potential to improve access to comprehensive, continuous obesity care, but care models need to improve upon the one observed in the Eucalyptus Australia DWLS to mitigate common real-world program attrition factors.

BACKGROUND
Treatment adherence and persistence are crucial to achieve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Early response to a new therapy may lead to improved treatment adherence and associated outcomes.


OBJECTIVE
To assess the effect of early response to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) therapy, as indicated by reduced hemoglobin A1c (A1c) and body weight, on long-term adherence and persistence.


METHODS
Adults aged ≥ 18 years with T2D initiated with GLP-1 RA therapy after January 1, 2010, were identified from the IBM Explorys Therapeutic Dataset. Patients were required to have health care utilization ≥ 6 months before and ≥ 18 months after the index prescription. Changes in A1c and body weight from baseline through 6 months were assessed for all patients; early response was defined by > 1% reduction in A1c and > 3% reduction in body weight within 3-6 months. Adherence (assessed as the proportion of days covered [PDC] ≥ 80%) and nonpersistence/discontinuation (indicated by a gap in therapy ≥ 60 days) over 18 months were evaluated among early responders versus nonresponders. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the effect of early response to GLP-1 RA therapy on adherence and discontinuation over 18 months.


RESULTS
Among 8,329 identified patients, 33.3% and 31.2% experienced early response as indicated by reductions in A1c > 1% point and in body weight > 3% from baseline, respectively. Significantly higher proportions (P < 0.001) of early responders in both reduced A1c and body weight were adherent over 18 months compared with patients without an early response (A1c: 45.0% vs. 37.1%; body weight: 43.3% vs. 38.0%). Significantly lower proportions (P < 0.001) of early responders discontinued over 18 months compared with patients without an early response (A1c: 61.4% vs. 67.9%; body weight: 61.9% vs. 67.5%). After controlling for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics including baseline weight, baseline A1c, oral antidiabetes drug use, insulin use, and the presence of comorbidity of diabetes, patients were more likely to be adherent over 18 months if they had reductions in A1c > 1% (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.36-1.85) or body weight reduction > 3% (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.02-1.36) at 3-6 months compared with those without an early response. Similarly, the early responders had significantly lower likelihood of discontinuation compared with those without early response (A1c > 1%; OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.53-0.72; body weight > 3%; OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.70-0.94).


CONCLUSIONS
Early response to GLP-1 RA therapy was associated with significantly increased adherence and reduced likelihood of discontinuation.

Guidelines (ADA 2023 and KDIGO 2020) recommend treatment with GLP-1RAs in advanced CKD and ESRD because of their cardiovascular benefits, low risk of hypoglycemia, and potential renal benefits. GLP-1RA are vastly under-prescribed in this population, mainly due to concerns related to tolerability. We compared persistence rate with GLP-1RA vs dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) in this population. We extracted EHR data from a university health system from patients with T2DM and GFR <30 treated with either GLP-1RA or DPP-4i (2012- 2022). All charts were manually reviewed to confirm treatment start & stop date and reason for discontinuation. At the time of treatment initiation, those treated with GLP-1RA (N=149) vs DPP-4i (N=87) were younger, more likely to be female (51% vs 44%) and had a higher BMI. Only 12.7% and 9.2% of patients discontinued treatment with GLP-1RA and DPP-4i, respectively, within 180 days of initiation. The average treatment duration was 1036 and 1109 days with 34.9% and 54% having discontinued treatment at the time of data extraction. The maximum tolerated dose of GLP-1RA were comparable to that expected in patients without CKD (Table). Persistence with GLP-1RA treatment in patients with T2DM and advanced CKD is similar to DPP-4i and the vast majority tolerated the highest approved dose of GLP-1RA, confirming their tolerability in this population.

The superior efficacy and safety of semaglutide once-weekly (QW), compared with dulaglutide, liraglutide, or exenatide QW, have been demonstrated in the SUSTAIN trials. This study assessed treatment persistence and adherence to semaglutide QW versus dulaglutide, liraglutide, or exenatide QW in a real-world setting. This retrospective, database study used Optum’s de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database to identify glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) treatment-naïve adult patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) initiating semaglutide QW, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or exenatide QW between January 1, 2018 and April 30, 2019. Persistence (time remaining on treatment) was assessed with Kaplan–Meier survival estimates and Cox proportional hazard models. Adherence was assessed using proportion of days covered (PDC) and proportion of patients with PDC > 80%. Of 56,715 patients included, 3279 received semaglutide QW, 27,891 dulaglutide, 17,186 liraglutide, and 8359 exenatide QW. Patients initiating semaglutide QW were younger and with lower percentage of Medicare coverage than patients initiating the comparators. Persistence at 360 days was significantly higher for semaglutide QW (67.0%) versus dulaglutide (56.0%), liraglutide (40.4%), and exenatide QW (35.5%); p < 0.001 for all comparisons. Compared with semaglutide QW, the discontinuation rate was significantly higher for dulaglutide (hazard ratio [HR] 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13, 1.32; p < 0.001), liraglutide (HR 1.80; 95% CI 1.66, 1.95; p < 0.001), and exenatide QW (HR 2.12; 95% CI 1.96, 2.30; p < 0.001). Adherence to semaglutide QW versus liraglutide at 360 days and to exenatide QW was 39.1% versus 30.0% [p = 0.07] and 27.7% [p = 0.02], respectively. Adherence to dulaglutide at 360 days was numerically higher than semaglutide QW (43.2% versus 39.1%; p = 0.45) but did not reach statistical significance. Persistence with semaglutide QW was significantly greater than comparators, while adherence was comparable or greater. Together with earlier results from double-blind clinical studies, these data support semaglutide QW use for treatment of patients with T2D.

In type 2 diabetes (T2D), persistence with injectable glucose-lowering therapy is associated with better outcomes. This study used real-world pharmacy data to report on persistence with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in patients with T2D in France. This retrospective cohort analysis presents longitudinal data from approximately 7500 French retail pharmacies that filled GLP-1-RA prescriptions for GLP-1 RA-naïve patients with T2D (‘index therapy’: dulaglutide; once-weekly exenatide [exenatide QW]; twice-daily exenatide [exenatide BID]; liraglutide) between January 2015 and December 2016 (follow-up ≥ 12 months). The main outcome was treatment persistence (absence of discontinuation [gap following index therapy prescription ≥ 2-fold the expected duration of that prescription] or switch [new non-index glucose-lowering prescription issued ≤ 30 days before/after index therapy discontinuation]). Persistence was calculated as the median duration through Kaplan–Meier survival analysis over the variable follow-up period and as the proportion of patients persistent at 12 months. In addition to persistence outcomes (discontinuation/switch), three other treatment modifications were assessed: augmentation/intensification with a new non-index glucose-lowering therapy; off-label dose increase (daily dose > 20 μg for exenatide BID; two consecutive prescriptions with daily dose > 1.8 mg for liraglutide); and off-label dose decrease (two consecutive prescriptions with average daily dose lower than the index dose). Off-label dose changes were not assessed for dulaglutide or exenatide QW (as single-dose, prefilled pens). Median persistence was longest for dulaglutide (373 days) versus liraglutide (205 days), exenatide QW (184 days) and exenatide BID (93 days). Twelve months after treatment initiation, the percentage of persistent patients ranged from 51% (dulaglutide) to 21% (exenatide BID). Overall, treatment modification occurred less commonly for dulaglutide than for the other index GLP-1 RAs. This analysis revealed marked differences in persistence among GLP-1 RAs, which was highest for dulaglutide and lowest for exenatide BID. The prospective TROPHIES study will provide additional information about persistence with dulaglutide and liraglutide, including reasons for treatment modifications. Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who continue to take injectable glucose-lowering therapy for the duration of time recommended by their physician (i.e. those who are ‘persistent’) usually have better outcomes than those who do not. Persistence may be quantified as the “the duration of time from initiation to discontinuation of therapy”. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are glucose-lowering agents that are often used as the first injectable drug if oral treatments are no longer effective. The aim of the current study was to use data from approximately 7500 retail pharmacies to report persistence with each of four GLP-1 RAs (dulaglutide, once-weekly exenatide [exenatide QW], twice-daily exenatide [exenatide BID] or liraglutide) in GLP-1 RA-naïve patients with T2D in France. Patients (N = 15,074) initiated treatment between January 2015 and December 2016 and were followed for ≥ 12 months. The total duration of follow-up varied among patients. Among patients, persistence over the variable follow-up period was highest for dulaglutide and lowest for exenatide BID: median persistence was longer for dulaglutide (373 days) than for liraglutide (205 days), exenatide QW (184 days) or exenatide BID (93 days). Twelve months after treatment initiation, the percentage of persistent patients ranged from 51% (dulaglutide) to 21% (exenatide BID), with intermediate values for exenatide QW (35%) and liraglutide (36%). This analysis has revealed marked differences in the persistence of patients for various GLP-1 RAs, with patients on dulaglutide showing the highest persistence and those on exenatide BID the lowest.
