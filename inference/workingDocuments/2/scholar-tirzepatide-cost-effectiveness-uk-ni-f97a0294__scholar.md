Introduction This study estimated the cost-effectiveness from a UK healthcare system perspective of tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg) compared to liraglutide (3 mg) both adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 (obesity), or with a BMI ≥ 27 to < 30 kg/m2 (overweight) + ≥ 1 obesity-related complication (‘trial population’). A subgroup analysis was performed in liraglutide’s National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended population (patients with a BMI of ≥ 35 kg/m2 with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia and a high risk of cardiovascular disease [CVD]). Methods A lifetime simulation model evaluated the costs and long-term clinical outcomes of each treatment. The base-case population was aligned to the population from the SURMOUNT-1 trial. The subgroup analysis included a 2-year stopping rule for liraglutide to reflect the NICE reimbursement criteria. Treatment efficacy was informed by a network meta-analysis. Patients were at risk of developing obesity-related complications such as diabetes and cardiovascular complications, calculated using published risk equations applied to modelled changes in risk factors. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs; cost/quality-adjusted life year [QALY]) were calculated. Results In the trial population, all doses of tirzepatide were dominant to liraglutide, with estimated cost savings and QALY gains. In liraglutide’s UK recommended population the estimated ICERs for tirzepatide vs liraglutide were £5401–7864/QALY gained across doses; the change in results is primarily due to the 2-year stopping rule for liraglutide in this population. In both populations, all doses of tirzepatide demonstrated reductions in at least five of seven complications compared to liraglutide, most notably for knee replacements (29–46% reduction) and diabetes (25–48% reduction). Conclusion On the basis of this simulation model, at the UK willingness-to-pay threshold (£20,000/QALY gained), tirzepatide is a cost-effective treatment compared to liraglutide for overweight and obesity, in both the full license SURMOUNT-1 trial population and in liraglutide’s specific NICE reimbursed population.

ABSTRACT The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) was established a quarter of a century ago in 1999 to regulate the cost‐effectiveness of pharmaceuticals (and other health technologies) for the NHS. Drawing on medical sociology theories of corporate bias, neoliberalism, pluralism/polycentricity and regulatory capture, the purpose of this article is to examine the applicability of those theories to NICE as a key regulatory agency in the UK health system. Based on approximately 7 years of documentary research, interviews with expert informants and observations of NICE‐related meetings, this paper focuses particularly on NICE's relationship with the interests of the pharmaceutical industry compared with other stakeholder interests at the meso‐organisational level. Consideration of the interaction between the UK Government and the pharmaceutical industry in relation to NICE is presented together with the analysis of revolving doors and conflicts of interest of NICE experts/advisors. The nature of policy changes over time (e.g. accelerated assessment pathways and industry fees for regulatory appraisals) and how they relate to the relevant stakeholder interests is also investigated. It is concluded that NICE is largely characterised by neoliberal corporate bias, though some elements of its organisation are also consistent with theories of capture, pluralism and polycentricity.

Background Long-term conditions (LTCs) are major public health problems with a considerable health-related and economic burden. Modelling is key in assessing costs and benefits of different disease management strategies, including routine monitoring, in the conditions of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in primary care. Objective This review aimed to identify published model-based cost-effectiveness studies of routine laboratory testing strategies in these LTCs to inform a model evaluating the cost effectiveness of testing strategies in the UK. Methods We searched the Medline and Embase databases from inception to July 2023; the National Institute for Health and Care Institute (NICE) website was also searched. Studies were included if they were model-based economic evaluations, evaluated testing strategies, assessed regular testing, and considered adults aged >16 years. Studies identified were summarised by testing strategies, model type, structure, inputs, assessment of uncertainty, and conclusions drawn. Results Five studies were included in the review, i.e. Markov (n = 3) and microsimulation (n = 2) models. Models were applied within T2DM (n = 2), hypertension (n = 1), T2DM/hypertension (n = 1) and CKD (n = 1). Comorbidity between all three LTCs was modelled to varying extents. All studies used a lifetime horizon, except for a 10-year horizon T2DM model, and all used quality-adjusted life-years as the effectiveness outcome, except a TD2M model that used glycaemic control. No studies explicitly provided a rationale for their selected modelling approach. UK models were available for diabetes and CKD, but these compared only a limited set of routine monitoring tests and frequencies. Conclusions There were few studies comparing routine testing strategies in the UK, indicating a need to develop a novel model in all three LTCs. Justification for the modelling technique of the identified studies was lacking. Markov and microsimulation models, with and without comorbidities, were used; however, the findings of this review can provide data sources and inform modelling approaches for evaluating the cost effectiveness of testing strategies in all three LTCs.

PURPOSE
Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the commonest cause of adult spinal cord dysfunction worldwide, for which surgery is the mainstay of treatment. At present, there is limited literature on the costs associated with the surgical management of DCM, and none from the United Kingdom (UK). This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DCM surgery within the National Health Service, UK.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Incidence of DCM was identified from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database for a single year using five ICD-10 diagnostic codes to represent DCM. Health Resource Group (HRG) data was used to estimate the mean incremental surgery (treatment) costs compared to non-surgical care, and the incremental effect (quality adjusted life year (QALY) gain) was based on data from a previous study. A cost per QALY value of <£30,000/QALY (GBP) was considered acceptable and cost-effective, as per the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken (±5%, ±10% and ±20%) to account for variance in both the cost of admission and QALY gain.


RESULTS
The total number of admissions for DCM in 2018 was 4,218. Mean age was 62 years, with 54% of admissions being of working age (18-65 years). The overall estimated cost of admissions for DCM was £38,871,534 for the year. The mean incremental (per patient) cost of surgical management of DCM was estimated to be £9,216 (ranged £2,358 to £9,304), with a QALY gain of 0.64, giving an estimated cost per QALY value of £14,399/QALY. Varying the QALY gain by ±20%, resulted in cost/QALY figures between £12,000 (+20%) and £17,999 (-20%).


CONCLUSIONS
Surgery is estimated to be a cost-effective treatment of DCM amongst the UK population.

Background
 Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a rare, life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy. Caplacizumab is a humanized nanobody that inhibits formation of microthrombi in iTTP by disrupting binding of von Willebrand factor to platelets. It is the only treatment approved in combination with plasma exchange therapy (PEX) and immunosuppression (IS) for the treatment of iTTP. The United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) committee reviewed cost-effectiveness of caplacizumab. The committee concluded that addition of caplacizumab to PEX+IS is cost-effective and recommended that the drug be reimbursed in the UK. The Sanofi Promise Warranty Program ® (SPWP) was introduced in January 2023 in the US. It refunds the full cost of caplacizumab to the hospital when treatment is discontinued due to non-response defined as refractoriness (patient with platelet counts <50 × 10 9/L after 4 days of combined treatment with caplacizumab and PEX+IS; up to 6 doses are refunded), or exacerbation (new drop in platelet count after initial platelet count normalization [>150 × 10 9/L], necessitating re-initiation of PEX after ruling out any causes for the drop in platelet count other than iTTP pathophysiology, up to 12 pre-exacerbation doses are refunded).
 Objectives
 To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding caplacizumab to PEX+IS from a US perspective within the context of SPWP.
 Methods
 The NICE model was adapted to the US setting by replacing UK costs with US costs and discount rates. All clinical assumptions and structure remain unchanged. Clinical inputs were derived from the HERCULES trial (NCT02553317) intent-to-treat population (mean age: 46 years; females: 69%, exacerbation rates: 4.17% during double blind phase and 12.50% in total; refractoriness: 0%). The model consisted of a 3-month decision tree, which captured patient treatment and outcomes over the acute iTTP episode, followed by a long-term Markov model (time horizon: up to 55 years; 3-monthly cycles; Figure 1). An annual discount rate of 3% was applied for both costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
 Under the SPWP, the cost of caplacizumab was assumed to be $0 for refractory patients and those who exacerbate early, no discount was applied for patients who experience exacerbations after drug discontinuation, however, clinical outcomes were captured.
 Results
 Prior to the SPWP, caplacizumab addition to PEX+IS delivered a gain of 1.75 QALYs (2.96 life-years [LYs]) as compared with PEX+IS alone, at an increased lifetime cost of $256,000. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $146,350 per QALY and $86,420 per LY gained ( Table 1).
 An estimated 4.17% of treated patients qualified for the SPWP. With this outcomes-based program, the ICER improved to $138,480 per QALY and $81,780 per LY gained, respectively ( Table 1).
 Conclusion
 Based on these analyses using the UK NICE model adapted with US costs, caplacizumab is cost-effective considering WTP threshold of $150,000 to $200,000 and has improved cost-effectiveness when the warranty program is taken into account. Outcomes based programs can improve the cost effectiveness of a treatment in addition to mitigating concerns of perceived uncertainty of efficacy in treating patients with iTTP in the US.
