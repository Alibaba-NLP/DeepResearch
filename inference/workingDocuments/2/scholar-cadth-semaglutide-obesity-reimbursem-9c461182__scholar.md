CADTH reimbursement reviews are comprehensive assessments of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, as well as patient and clinician perspectives, of a drug or drug class.&#x0D;
The assessments inform non-binding recommendations that help guide the reimbursement decisions of Canada's federal, provincial, and territorial governments, with the exception of Quebec.&#x0D;
This review assesses semaglutide (Wegovy), 2.4 mg subcutaneous injection.&#x0D;
Indication: As an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obesity), or 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least 1 weight-related comorbidity such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, or obstructive sleep apnea.&#x0D;

<jats:p>&#x0D;
CADTH recommends that Wegovy should not be reimbursed by public drug plans for chronic weight management in adult patients.&#x0D;
Even though results from 4 clinical trials showed that patients treated with Wegovy for 68 weeks lost more body weight compared to those who received placebo, there was no evidence to show this weight loss translates to improvements in weight-related comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular complications, osteoarthritis [the most common form of arthritis], and sleep apnea) because they were not studied.&#x0D;
Although results showed improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), the minimally important difference (MID) was not met, and it remains unknown if the differences were clinically meaningful.&#x0D;
Wegovy is effective for weight loss for up to 2 years with an acceptable side effect profile, but it is unclear whether it meets patient needs for reduced weight-related comorbidities and improved HRQoL.&#x0D;

3. [Semaglutide (Rybelsus)](http://canjhealthtechnol.ca/index.php/cjht/article/download/sr0637/sr0637)
Date published: 2021

<jats:p>&#x0D;
Clinical evidence suggests that Rybelsus should be reimbursed to treat type 2 diabetes in adults if it is used in addition to metformin or other antihyperglycemic agents and does not cost more than glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors.&#x0D;
Rybelsus is more costly than most similar diabetes treatments.&#x0D;
Rybelsus is expected to increase budgets by more than $38 million over 3 years.&#x0D;
To account for the high treatment cost, the price of Rybelsus should be reduced.&#x0D;
If Rybelsus is not reimbursed as an add-on treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes, there are several other alternative treatments available for these patients.&#x0D;

&#x0D;
as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications;&#x0D;
in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.&#x0D;

<jats:p>
The authors of an editorial published in CMAJ made 3 recommendations to incorporate new evidence into health technology assessments after the initial regulatory approval stage: incorporate automatic times for review or regular reviews of evidence, accept non-sponsor submissions, and audit prescribing for nonadherence to restricted drugs.
This response to the editorial outlines existing and new evolving initiatives at CADTH to address each of the 3 recommendations.

<jats:p>Background: Once weekly (OW) semaglutide 0.5-1.0 mg is a glucagon-like type-1 receptor agonist (GLR-1 RA) approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes and is currently under evaluation for treatment of obesity at a higher dose of 2.4 mg OW.   Objective: to provide an appraisal of WO semaglutide 2.4 mg for treatment of obesity. Methods: Pubmed research up to March 22. Randomized trials, pertinent animal studies, and reviews are included. Search terms were glucagon-like type 1 receptor agonists, weight loss, obesity, semaglutide, safety, efficacy.  Results: WO semaglutide 2.4 mg was evaluated as a weight loss agent in 3 well-designed clinical trials of 68 week-duration. In one trial including patients with type 2 diabetes, the difference in weight loss from baseline to week 68 between OW semaglutide and placebo was - 6.2 percentage points (95% CI, -7.3 to -5.2; P&lt;0.0001). In the other 2 studies that excluded patients with diabetes, the difference in weight loss between OW semaglutide and placebo ranged between -10.3% and -12.4%. A significantly higher proportion of participants in the semaglutide groups vs placebo groups achieved at least 5% of weight loss. The most common adverse effects of semaglutide were related to the gastrointestinal (GI) system. Across these 3 trials, premature discontinuation of OW semaglutide occurred in 6-7% vs 3% in placebo groups.  Conclusions: OW semaglutide may be a promising agent for treatment of obesity irrespective of presence of type 2 diabetes. Further studies are needed to establish its long-term safety and efficacy.</jats:p>
