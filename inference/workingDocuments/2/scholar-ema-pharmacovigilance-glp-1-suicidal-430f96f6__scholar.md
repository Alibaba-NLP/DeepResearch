Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) are widely used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity, providing metabolic and cardiovascular benefits. However, concerns have emerged about potential neuropsychiatric side effects, including suicidal ideation and behaviour, prompting investigations by regulatory bodies such as the FDA and EMA. This systematic review and meta‐analysis aimed to assess the association between GLP‐1RA use and the risk of suicidal ideation or behaviour.

• To determine whether there is a potential relationship between glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and suicidal or self-injurious behaviors (SSIBs). • Is there a direct association between GLP-1RAs and SSIBs? No evidence reasonably suggests an association between GLP-1RAs and SSIBs based on clinical characteristics, time-onset, disproportionality, and co-medication analysis. • Clinicians should pay more attention to the psychiatric status of patients with a history of neuropsychotropic drugs, and more comprehensive monitoring is needed to consider their susceptibility to SSIBs carefully. Background Establishing whether there is a potential relationship between glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and suicidal or self-injurious behaviors (SSIBs) is crucial for public safety. This study investigated the potential association between GLP-1RAs and SSIBs by exploring the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Methods A disproportionality analysis was conducted using post-marketing data from the FAERS repository (2018 Q1 to 2022 Q4). SSIB cases associated with GLP-1RAs were identified and analyzed through disproportionality analysis using the information component. The parametric distribution with a goodness-of-fit test was employed to analyze the time-to-onset, and the Ω shrinkage was used to evaluate the potential effect of co-medication on the occurrence of SSIBs. Results In total, 204 cases of SSIBs associated with GLP-1RAs, including semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, and albiglutide, were identified in the FAERS database. Time-of-onset analysis revealed no consistent mechanism for the latency of SSIBs in patients receiving GLP-1RAs. The disproportionality analysis did not indicate an association between GLP-1RAs and SSIBs. Co-medication analysis revealed 81 cases with antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines, which may be proxies of mental health comorbidities. Conclusions We found no signal of disproportionate reporting of an association between GLP-1RA use and SSIBs. Clinicians need to maintain heightened vigilance on patients premedicated with neuropsychotropic drugs. This contributes to the greater acceptance of GLP-1RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or obesity. Graphical Abstract

Abstract Background Recent reports of individuals experiencing suicidal and/or self-injurious behaviors while using liraglutide and semaglutide have heightened the concerns regarding neuropsychiatric safety of Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1RAs). As real-world evidence is very limited, we explored the association between GLP-1RA and suicide/self-injury by mining the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Methods The FAERS database was queried from 2005 Q2 to 2023 Q2. The Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) were used to conduct the disproportionality analysis. Results A total of 534 GLP-1RA-associated suicide/self-injury cases were reported in the FAERS during the study period. GLP-1RA did not cause a disproportionate increase in overall suicidal and self-injurious cases (ROR: 0.16, 95%CI 0.15-0.18, P < 0.001; EBGM05: 0.15). Stratified analyses found no safety signal of suicide/injury for GLP-1RA in both females and males. The ROR for suicide/self-injury with GLP-1RA was slightly elevated (ROR: 2.50, 95%CI 1.02-6.13, P = 0.05) in children, while the EBGM05 was < 2 in this population. No significant signal value was observed in other age groups. No over-reporting of suicide/self-injury was identified for GLP-1RA before or after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Conclusions The cases of suicide or self-injury reported to FAERS do not indicate any overall safety signal attributable to GLP-1RA at this time. Subgroup analysis revealed a marginal elevation of ROR for suicide and self-injury with GLP-1RA in children, but no safety signal was detected by EBGM05 in this population. Further large-scale prospective investigations are still warranted to further confirm this finding.

ABSTRACT Introduction Recently, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) received reports of suicidal thoughts and self-injury associated with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) liraglutide and semaglutide. Research design and methods Herein, we sought to evaluate suicidality associated with all GLP-1 RAs relative to other glucose-lowering agents currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Reports of suicidal ideation, “depression/suicidal”, suicidal behavior, suicidal attempts, and completed suicide associated with GLP-1 RA exposure reported to the FDA between 2005 and October 2023 were obtained from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). We present data using the reporting odds ratio (ROR). The ROR was considered significant when the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) was greater than 1.0. Results Disproportionate reporting of suicidal ideation and “depression/suicidal” was observed with semaglutide and liraglutide. Disproportionate reporting of suicidal behavior, suicide attempts, and completed suicide was not observed for any of the FDA-approved GLP-1 RAs. Conclusions Using the Bradford Hill criteria, however, and taking into consideration confounders, no causal link between GLP-1 RAs and suicidality exists.

Introduction The Atlas study, conducted in 2023, shows that the global prevalence of high body mass index (BMI) is expected to increase significantly by 2035, both in adults (from 42% to over 54%) and in young people aged 5-19 years (from 22% to 39%). Also in 2023, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a statement warning about the risk of suicidal thoughts and self-harm with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), including semaglutide, tirzepatide and liraglutide. The psychiatric safety of recently developed anti-obesity drugs has not been adequately studied. Objectives The objective of this study was to collate and evaluate the existing evidence regarding the psychiatric safety of GLP-1 RAs in individuals without major psychopathology. Methods A narrative literature review was carried out in the PubMed, Cochrane and Embase databases, selecting only the articles published in the last 4 years, using the following keywords: depression suicidal ideation, GLP-1 receptor agonists, semaglutide, tirzepatide, liraglutide. Results There is a complex relationship between body weight and depressive and anxiety disorders. Obesity can be understood as chronic low-grade inflammation of adipose tissue, and the activation of inflammatory pathways could lead to the development of depression and anxiety. Also, due to cultural norms, obesity contributes to increased body dissatisfaction and lower self-esteem, both of which are associated with depression and anxiety. All of these factors can contribute to the maintenance and worsening of anxiety and depression. In most trials, there was no evidence of an association between treatment with GLP-1 RAs and an increased risk of developing depression or suicidal thoughts/behaviour. Psychiatric adverse events were rare, occurring in only 1.2-1% of patients. Depression was the most common adverse event reported, followed by anxiety and suicidal ideation. Fatal outcomes occurred mainly in men and in people treated with liraglutide, which is associated with a higher risk of suicide than semaglutide. Tagliapietra et al suggest that the patient population receiving GLP-1RAs compared with other diabetes pharmacotherapies is a group with a higher basal risk of developing depression, rather than a causal effect of the drugs. Recent but limited real-world evidence suggests that the use of semaglutide is associated with reduced suicidal ideation and major depression. Conclusions The results of our analysis suggest that GLP-1 RAs did not increase the risk of developing symptoms of depression or suicidal thoughts. However, the severity and fatal outcomes of some of these reports warrant further investigation. People with obesity should be monitored for mental health problems so that they can receive appropriate support and care. Disclosure of Interest None Declared

Introduction Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are a class of pharmacological agents that have gained significant attention and utility in managing metabolic disorders, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, often in combination with behavioral therapy. These agents mimic the physiological actions of GLP-1, a hormone released from the gastrointestinal tract in response to food intake, thereby stimulating insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon release, slowing gastric emptying, and promoting satiety through both peripheral and central nervous system mechanisms. Beyond their metabolic benefits, GLP-1 RAs have shown potential antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, which may be mediated through neuroprotective mechanisms, reduction of neuroinflammation, and modulation of neurotransmitter systems. Objectives This systematic review aims to synthesize existing evidence on the effects of GLP-1 RAs on mental health outcomes, including both potential therapeutic benefits across various psychiatric disorders and the risk of associated adverse mental health effects. Methods This systematic review was conducted across PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria encompassed human and animal studies examining the impact of GLP-1 RAs on mental health. Data from 81 selected studies were extracted and analyzed, focusing on mental health outcomes and reported adverse effects. Results GLP-1 RAs exhibit potential beneficial effects on depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and reduced risk of suicidal ideation in animal and human models through antioxidative, anti-inflammatory mechanisms, and modulation of neurotransmitter pathways. Additionally, GLP-1 RAs were effective in reducing alcohol and substance use and binge eating behaviors. Adverse psychiatric effects associated with GLP-1 RAs, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, are noted in pharmacovigilance analyses, with variations among different GLP-1 RAs. Conclusions Our systematic review highlights the potential role of GLP-1 RAs in psychiatric care, underscoring their potential therapeutic benefits across a spectrum of mental health conditions. Animal studies consistently demonstrate positive outcomes, revealing antidepressant effects, modulation of addictive behaviors, and improvements in eating disorders through various neurobiological mechanisms. Human studies present a more nuanced landscape with conflicting evidence regarding the impact of GLP-1 RAs on depressive symptoms and other psychiatric outcomes, suggesting a need for further rigorous investigation. Despite these promising findings, significant limitations, such as study heterogeneity, funding biases, and the predominance of animal model data, temper definitive conclusions. Longitudinal and rigorous studies are warranted to elucidate the long-term effects and safety profile of GLP-1 RAs in psychiatric contexts. Disclosure of Interest None Declared

Background Semaglutide, liraglutide and tirzepatide are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists that are effective for weight reduction. Recent reports of patients experiencing suicidal thoughts and other psychiatric adverse events while using GLP-1 agonists have raised concerns about the potential risk of self-harm and led the European Medicines Agency to investigate these medications. Aim To identify and analyse the psychiatric adverse events associated with semaglutide, liraglutide and tirzepatide. Method All individual case safety reports for semaglutide, liraglutide, and tirzepatide reported to the EudraVigilance database from 01/01/2021 to 30/05/2023 were analysed. Descriptive statistics were used to explore study population characteristics. Results During the study period, 31,444 adverse event reports were identified: semaglutide (n = 13,956; 44.4%), liraglutide (n = 16,748; 53.2%), and tirzepatide (n = 740; 2.3%). There were 372 reports with psychiatric adverse event reports (n = 372; 1.18%) with a total of 481 adverse events. Women accounted for 65% (n = 242) of these reports. Depression was the most commonly reported adverse event (n = 187; 50.3%), followed by anxiety (n = 144; 38.7%) and suicidal ideation (n = 73; 19.6%). Nine deaths (8 with liraglutide and 1 with semaglutide) and 11 life-threatening outcomes (4 associated with liraglutide and 7 with semaglutide) were reported. The fatal outcomes occurred primarily among men (8 out of 9) resulting from completed suicidal attempts and depression. Conclusion Psychiatric adverse events comprised only 1.2% of the total reports for semaglutide, liraglutide, and tirzepatide. However, the severity and fatal outcomes of some of these reports warrant further investigation.

Introduction Brodalumab is a human interleukin-17 receptor A antagonist indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy and have failed to respond or have lost response to other systemic therapies. Although the US prescribing information for brodalumab includes a boxed warning regarding suicidal ideation and behavior, no causal association has been demonstrated. Here, we summarize 5 years of pharmacovigilance data, from August 15, 2017, through August 14, 2022, reported to Ortho Dermatologics by US patients and healthcare providers. Methods Prevalence of the most common adverse events (AEs) listed in the brodalumab package insert (incidence ≥ 1%) and AEs of special interest are described. Brodalumab exposure was estimated as the time from the first to last prescription-dispensing authorization dates. Data were collected from 4744 patients in the USA, with an estimated exposure of 5815 patient-years. Results Over 5 years, 11 cases of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events were reported (0.23 events/100 patients), a rate lower than that experienced by patients in the international Psoriasis Longitudinal Assessment and Registry. There were 106 serious infections. No serious fungal infections were reported. There were 40 confirmed and 2 suspected COVID-19 cases, with no new COVID-19-related deaths. Of 49 reported malignancies among 42 patients, 3 were deemed possibly related to brodalumab. No completed suicides and no new suicidal attempts were reported. Conclusion Five-year pharmacovigilance data are consistent with the established safety profile reported in long-term clinical trials and previous pharmacovigilance reports, with no new safety signals.

The European Medicines Authority (EMA) is a decentralised agency of the European Union (EU) responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines in the EU and the European economic Area (EEA). On July 11th, 2023, it issued a press release stating that PRAC (The EMA’s safety committee) was reviewing data on the potential risk of suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self-harm with medicines known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, including Ozempic (semaglutide), Saxenda (liraglutide) and Wegovy (semaglutide). This was in response to reports by the Icelandic Medicines Authority of patients on liraglutide and semaglutide experiencing suicidal tendencies and thoughts of self-harm. Such reported signals are rightly taken very seriously by the EMA. However, looking at Ozempic, one is stricken by the EU’s Medicine’s Authority lack of publicly highlighting warnings in view of three burning issues. Firstly, the rampant, rarely seen meteoric use of the drug, which is becoming a seeming status symbol for use in weight loss and is openly promulgated as such by media and movie moguls as such. Secondly, the fact that the use of Ozempic in weight-loss is off-label. And thirdly, thirdly the established number of still-increasing, serious complications which carry serious health risks and even a risk to life in the face of this orgiastic misuse of a GLP-1 receptor agonist.
