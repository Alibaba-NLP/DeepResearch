Background:
 GLP-1 Receptor Agonists have become widely used for treating Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 and weight loss in patients across the United States. However, new data reports increasing cases of pancreatitis, acute kidney injury, increased Hba1c, and thyroid malignancy.
 
 
 Research question:
 Like many medications, GLP-1 receptor antagonists have a risk of side effects. The question is which medication, Semaglutide or Tirzepatide, has the highest risk of developing the above mentioned side effects.
 
 
 Goals:
 Using the FAERS database to calculate the reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the risk of pancreatitis, acute kidney injury, increased HgA1c, and thyroid malignancy.
 
 
 Methods:
 The FDA's FAERS system gathers information on adverse events and medication errors. The data shows that both Semaglutide and Tirzepatide have been linked to pancreatitis, acute kidney injury, elevation in HbA1c, and various types of thyroid malignancies. For consistent analysis, this data covers the period from 2022 to 2024 for both drugs.
 
 
 Results:
 January 2022- March 2024 data showed that Semaglutide and Tirzepatide had 11584 AE and 29453 AE, respectively. Semaglutide had a higher risk of developing pancreatitis, elevation of HbA1c, and thyroid malignancy compared to Tirzepatide (ROR 2.62, 95% CI 2.21-3.10) (ROR 1.72, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.15), (ROR 4.32, 95%CI 2.66 to 7.01) respectively. However, Semaglutide had 72% fewer reported cases of AKI than Semaglutide (ROR 0.28, 95% CI= 0.20 to 0.37).
 
 
 Conclusion:
 Lately, the popularity of GLP-1 Agonists is soaring mainly due to their role in facilitating weight loss and providing additional cardiovascular benefits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study comparing the likelihood of these four AEs with Semaglutideand Tirzepatide, using the FAERS Database. Being the newer agent, Tirzepatide is significantly less strongly associated with three AEs than AKI. Additional studies are needed to investigate further the epidemiology and pathophysiology of AKI with Tirzepatide use. In the meantime, Tirzepatide should be the drug of choice in patients who are at high risk for pancreatitis, thyroid cancer, and poorly controlled DM. Semaglutide might be considered in chronic kidney disease patients.

Background With the continuously increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, known for their dual benefits of effectively controlling blood glucose levels while also reducing weight and lowering cardiovascular disease risks, have been widely employed in the treatment of this condition. In recent years, semaglutide has garnered significant attention as the only injectable and orally administered glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA). However, it is important to note that different routes of administration may lead to varying adverse events in patients. The aim of this study is to compare the adverse event profiles of semaglutide across different routes of administration by analyzing the adverse event reporting system of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The findings from this analysis will provide valuable insights for clinical practice and drug surveillance. Methods Data was extracted from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, specifically focusing on the period from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2023. A comparative analysis was conducted using disproportionality analysis, reporting odds ratio (ROR), and stratified analysis methods to assess and compare the signals of adverse events (AE) and the time to onset of adverse reactions associated with different routes of administration of semaglutide from 2017 to 2023. Results A total of 22,287 adverse reaction records related to semaglutide were identified in the FAERS database. A comparative analysis was performed on 16,346 records of subcutaneous administration and 2,496 records of oral administration. Different routes of administration can lead to varying adverse reaction outcomes. Compared to oral administration, subcutaneous injection is more likely to result in adverse events related to the endocrine system. Oral administration is more likely to induce adverse events in the gastrointestinal system. Additionally, it significantly accelerates the onset of adverse reactions. The comparative analysis of all relevant results indicates that semaglutide can lead to different adverse reaction events depending on the route of administration. Furthermore, there are significant differences in the time of onset for these adverse reactions. Conclusion Semaglutide exhibits variations in adverse reaction events and the time of onset across different routes of administration. Therefore, when selecting the route of administration for semaglutide, clinicians should consider the risk of adverse events and weigh them against the clinical benefits. Based on these considerations, appropriate guidance and recommendations can be provided to patients.

Background Semaglutide was approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic weight management in obesity or overweight adults. However, real-world data regarding its long-term gastrointestinal safety and tolerability in large sample population are incomplete. We evaluated semaglutide-associated gastrointestinal safety signals by data mining of the FDA pharmacovigilance database. Methods Reporting odds ratio (ROR) was employed to quantify the signals of semaglutide-related gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) from 2018 to 2022. Serious and non-serious cases were compared by Mann-Whitney U test or Chi-squared (χ2) test, and signals were prioritized using a rating scale. Results We identified 5,442 cases of semaglutide-associated gastrointestinal AEs, with 45 signals detected, ranging from a ROR025 of 1.01 (hypoaesthesia oral) to 42.03 (eructation), among which 17 AEs were identified as new and unexpected signals. Patient age (p < 0.001) and body weight (p = 0.006) rather than sex (p = 0.251) might be associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal AEs severity. Notably, the association between semaglutide and gastrointestinal disorders remained when stratified by age, body weight, sex and reporter type. One strong, 22 moderate and 22 weak clinical priority signals were defined. The median time-to-onset (TTO) for strong clinical priority signal was 23 days, while for moderate and weak, they were 6 and 7 days, respectively. All of the disproportionality signals had early failure type features, suggesting that the risk of gastrointestinal AEs occurrence gradually decreased over time. Conclusion Our study provided a deeper and broader understanding of semaglutide's gastrointestinal safety profiles, which would help healthcare professionals to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs in clinical practice.

Background: Pancreatitis is characterized by inflammation of the pancreas and significantly affects quality of life. Less than 5% of pancreatitis cases are drug-induced, but recent evidence suggests a substantial risk associated with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). The aim of this study was to compare the risk of developing pancreatitis between those using GLP-1 RAs and those using sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Methods: This study was done using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 2019 to 2021. This database contains information from diverse submissions from healthcare providers, patients, and manufacturers. To ensure fairness and accuracy, the risk of pancreatitis associated with other hypoglycemic agents (SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors) was also investigated. Traditional and Bayesian statistical analysis methods were used to identify disproportionate statistics and included the reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM), and information component (IC). A drug–adverse-event combination that met the criteria of all four indices was deemed a signal. Results: The analysis of 2,313 pancreatitis reports linked to hypoglycemic agents revealed a predominant association with GLP-1 RA (70.2%) compared to DPP-4 inhibitors (15%) and SGLT2 (14.7%). Most of these reports involved female patients (50.4%), and the highest incidence occurred in those over 50 years old (38.4%). Additionally, 17.7% of the reports were associated with serious events. The ROR was significant for the risk of pancreatitis when using DPP-4 (13.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.84-14.70), while the ROR for GLP-1 was 9.65 (95% CI 9.17-10.16). The EBGM was highest with DPP-4 (12.25), followed by GLP-1 (8.64), while IC was highest with DPP-4 inhibitors (3.61). Liraglutide had the greatest association with pancreatitis among the GLP-1 RAs (ROR: 6.83, 95% CI 6.60-7.07). Conclusion: The findings show that pancreatitis has a strong link with DPP-4 inhibitors and GPL1 agonists, which pose a greater risk. Among the GLP-1 agonist medications, liraglutide has been found to have an association with pancreatitis.

ABSTRACT Background Metformin has the potential for treating numerous diseases, but there are still many unrecognized and unreported adverse events (AEs). Methods We selected data from the United States FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from the first quarter (Q1) of 2004 to the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2022 for disproportionality analysis to assess the association between metformin and related adverse events. Results In this study 10,500,295 case reports were collected from the FAERS database, of which 56,674 adverse events related to metformin were reported. A total of 643 preferred terms (PTs) and 27 system organ classes (SOCs) that were significant disproportionality conforming to the four algorithms simultaneously were included. The SOCs included metabolic and nutritional disorders (p = 0.00E + 00), gastrointestinal disorders (p = 0.00E + 00) and others. PT levels were screened for adverse drug reaction (ADR) signals such as acute pancreatitis (p = 0.00E + 00), melas syndrome, pemphigoid (p = 0.00E + 00), skin eruption (p = 0.00E + 00) and drug exposure during pregnancy (p = 0.00E + 00). Conclusion Most of our results were consistent with the specification, but some new signals of adverse reactions such as acute pancreatitis were not included. Therefore, further studies are needed to validate unlabeled adverse reactions and provide important support for clinical monitoring and risk identification of metformin.

Timely identification and discontinuation of culprit‐drug is the cornerstone of clinical management of drug‐induced acute pancreatitis (AP), but the comprehensive landscape of AP culprit‐drugs is still lacking. To provide the current overview of AP culprit‐drugs to guide clinical practice, we reviewed the adverse event (AE) reports associated with AP in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 2004 to 2022, and summarized a potential AP culprit‐drug list and its corresponding AE report quantity proportion. The disproportionality analysis was used to detect adverse drug reaction (ADR) signals for each drug in the drug list, and the ADR signal distribution was integrated to show the risk characteristic of drugs according to the ADR signal detection results. In the FAERS database, a total of 62,206 AE reports were AP‐related, in which 1,175 drugs were reported as culprit‐drug. On the whole, metformin was the drug with the greatest number of AE reports, followed by quetiapine, liraglutide, exenatide, and sitagliptin. Drugs used in diabetes was the drug class with the greatest number of AE reports, followed by immunosuppressants, psycholeptics, drugs for acid‐related disorders, and analgesics. In disproportionality analysis, 595 drugs showed potential AP risk, whereas 580 drugs did not show any positive ADR signal. According to the positive–negative distribution of the ADR signal for drug classes, the drug class with the greatest number of positive drugs was antineoplastic agents. In this study, we provided the current comprehensive landscape of AP culprit‐drugs from the pharmacovigilance perspective, which can provide reference information for clinical practice.

Objective: While several drugs have been linked to acute pancreatitis (AP), the AP-related risk of most drugs remains unclear. This study investigated the risk factors for drug-induced AP by analyzing a large dataset from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: The reporting odds ratios (ROR) were used to assess the reports of drug-induced AP from the first quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2022. Single-factor, LASSO, and multi-factor regression analysis were performed to explore drug-related AP-related risk factors. Bonferroni correction was applied for the multiple comparisons performed. Results: A total of 264 drugs associated with AP, including antineoplastic drugs (35/264), antidiabetic drugs (28/264), antibacterial drugs (24/264), immunomodulatory drugs (11/264), antipsychotic drugs (6/264), and other drugs (160/264) were retrieved. Multi-factor analysis showed that males, age 41–54 years old, and 36 drugs, including Tigecycline, were risk factors for drug-related AP. The median time to drug-related AP onset was 31 days (interquartile range [IQR] 7–102 days) and about 75% of adverse events occurred within 100 days. Conclusion: These findings may help clinicians to identify drug-related AP at the early stage and can be used to inform future studies of drug-related AP pathogenesis.
