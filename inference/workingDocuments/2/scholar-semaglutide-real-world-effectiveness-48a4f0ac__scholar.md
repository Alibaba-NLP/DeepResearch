Given its recent commercialization, there is little real-life evidence on its effectiveness, safety, and tolerability. Primary objective: to evaluate the effectiveness (HbA1c, Weight, Blood Pressure, Albumin Creatinine Ratio (ACR)) safety and tolerability of oSEMA 3-6 months after the start of treatment in the real world clinical practice. Secondary objective: to describe the main indications of oSEMA in real life. Material and methods: short-term retrospective observational study of all patients with oSEMA prescription in two health departments between November 2021 and November 2022. Statistical approach: descriptive analysis (median [IQR]); Wilcoxon test - paired data for evaluate changes in main outcomes and logistic regression to determine associations between provider speciality and short-term non-adherence. Ethics committee approval Ref.: 2022-0386. Results: 170 patients were included in these preliminary data. The median age was 63 [55.0 -70.0] years, with male predominance (60.5%), initial weight of 95 [83-112]kg and BMI 36.03 [31.04-39.34] Kg/m2. Median T2D evolution was 8 [2.0-12.0] years, 27.3% have an established CVD and 14% DKD. Prior therapy for T2D: 11% GLP1 receptor agonists (RA), 25.6% DPP4 inhibitors, 47.1% SGLT-2 inhibitors and 22.7% under insulin therapy. The oSEMA provider specialties were mainly: endocrinology (ENDO) 39.2%, primary physician (PCare) 35.7% and cardiology (CAR) 20.9%. At the time of this analysis, the maintenance dose was 7 mg in 98.4% of patients. The changes in the main clinical outcomes at 3-6 months of follow-up were: HbA1c 7.8 [6.9-8.6]% vs 6.9 [6.2-7.7]%, p= 0.0001; weight 95.5 [81-112] Kg vs 90 [74.5-105.2]Kg, p= 0.0001; ACR (baseline ACR subpopulation > 30) 57 [39. 5- 110.9] mg/g vs. CAC 37.0 [14.5-58.0], p=0.005; SBP 135 [125-150] mmHg vs. SBP 121.5 [109.50-31.00], p= 0.028. Treatment was discontinued in 23.8% of cases (ENDO 14%, PCare 26, CAR 30%). Having the index prescription ordered by ENDO were associated with lower odds of non-adherence (OR 0.48[0.22-1.05], p = 0.06). The most frequent causes of oSEMA discontinuation were the lack of continuity of care after hospitalization (renewal / titration) (10.5%) and digestive intolerance (8.7%). Conclusions: Oral SEMA at medium doses is effective in the short term with 1% reductions in HbA1c, 5% weight loss and a significant reduction in microalbuminuria. Oral SEMA is usually started in obese PLWT2D naïve to aRGLP1, with inadequate metabolic control and without CV disease. No serious adverse events have been recorded. Mistakes in the transition from hospital discharge to primary care were the cause of almost 50% of short-term non-adherence. Presentation: Thursday, June 15, 2023

Diabetes is increasingly becoming a significant health concern globally, including in India, where its prevalence continues to increase. Being overweight often acts as a catalyst for developing diabetes, exacerbating the condition and increasing the risk of other serious health complications such as heart disease, kidney problems, and nerve damage. Peptide-based molecules like semaglutide have proved their efficacy in controlling glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and body weight in diabetic patients.
 
 
 
 The present study aims to determine the effectiveness of oral semaglutide in a real-world setting.
 
 
 
 This retrospective study included patients ≥18 years of age prescribed oral semaglutide with a follow-up visit between 80 and 160 days post-prescription and had baseline body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 and HbA1c levels ≤10.0%. The primary endpoints were to assess changes in HbA1c level, BMI, and body weight from the baseline. The secondary endpoints were to determine the changes in postprandial blood sugar (PPBS), fasting blood sugar (FBS), and blood pressure. The analysis also encompassed data on comorbid conditions and concomitant medications prescribed.
 
 
 
 A total of 188 patients met the study eligibility criteria. At the follow-up visit, a statistically significant mean reduction of 0.34% in HbA1c levels and a weight loss of 1.83 kg were observed. The average duration between baseline and follow-up visit was 114.14 ± 21.5 days. The mean reduction in the BMI was 0.73 kg/m2 (P < 0.001). During the follow-up visit, the PPBS level decreased by 9.95 mg/dL and the FBS level decreased by 5.02 mg/dL. Additionally, the effect of semaglutide on blood pressure was evident, with a reduction in systolic blood pressure by 1.69 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 1.30 mm Hg. The most common comorbid condition was dyslipidemia (66.49%), followed by hypertension (51.60%) and obesity (39.36%).
 
 
 
 Semaglutide demonstrated significant reductions in glycemic parameters, body weight, and blood pressure.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) have demonstrated cardiovascular and renal benefits in obese diabetic patients. However, the evidence for oral semaglutide in kidney transplant (KT) patients is very limited. Our study aims to analyze the effectiveness and safety of oral semaglutide in diabetic KT patients.
 
 
 
 Retrospective cohort study of KT with diabetes who started oral semaglutide in 3 Spanish hospitals (Puerta del Mar University Hospital, Jerez de la Frontera University Hospital and Puerto Real University Hospital) between December 2021 and December 2023. None of them had previously received subcutaneous GLP1-RA. Clinical and demographic variables were analyzed. Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), proteinuria, and weight were collected at the start of the treatment and after 6 and 12 months. We analyze glycemic control, blood pressure, lipid profile and trough level, dose and C/D ratio of tacrolimus. Acute rejections (AR), de novo donor-specific antibodies (dnDSA) and adverse effects were documented. Parametric and non-parametric tests were performed according to the normality of the sample.
 
 
 
 In this period, 22 KT with DM started treatment with oral Semaglutide, of which 16 patients completed follow-up for 6 months and 11 patients for 1 year. Fourteen (63.6%) had developed post-transplant DM. The mean age was 61 years, and 77% were men. The mean baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 46.1 ml/min/1.73 m2, the baseline body mass index was 34.7 kg/m2 and the median KT vintage was 45 months. Three patients were on treatment with SGLT2i at the start of the drug. Variables compared during the follow-up are shown in Table 1. Four patients (18%) suffered gastrointestinal side effects. No dnDSA were documented during follow-up. One episode of AR was documented after drug initiation.
 
 
 
 We show the longest series of oral semaglutide in KT patients. Our results support that it can be a good option for managing DM in KT, especially in obese patients.

Introduction This study compared the effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4 mg vs. no treatment with obesity medication (OM) for reducing weight and improving cardiometabolic risk factors among adults with obesity or overweight. Methods This real-world, retrospective, observational cohort study included adults with obesity or overweight with ≥ 1 obesity-related complication treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg identified in a large US claims and medical record database (December 15, 2020, through May 30, 2024). Patients were matched 1:4 to non-treated patients using a propensity score (PS) model. Change in weight and body mass index (BMI) (primary outcomes) and changes in cardiometabolic risk factors (secondary outcomes; systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP], glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], and triglycerides) were assessed from baseline to 12 months. PS matching and generalized linear models were used to compare outcomes. Results A total of 8,857 semaglutide 2.4 mg-treated patients were matched to 35,428 non-treated patients. After matching, baseline characteristics between cohorts were well balanced in mean age (47.6 vs. 47.8 years), mean BMI (36.7 kg/m2 in both cohorts), and gender (76% vs. 77% female). Weight data were available for 4,038 and 1,186 patients in the non-treated and semaglutide cohort, respectively. Estimated treatment differences between cohorts showed the semaglutide 2.4 mg cohort had significantly greater percentage (− 15.0%) and absolute reduction in weight (– 15.7 kg), greater reduction in BMI (– 4.2 kg/m2), and significantly greater improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, including SBP (– 6.7 mmHg), DBP (– 2.7 mmHg), HbA1c (– 0.5%), HDL-C (1.2 mg/dl), LDL-C (– 10.4 mg/dl), and triglycerides (– 34.3 mg/dl) at 12 months. Conclusion In this real-world study, adults with obesity or overweight treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg had greater reductions in weight and improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors compared with patients not treated with OM at 12 months.

5. [The Effect of Lifestyle Coaching Design on Patient Engagement and Weight Loss in Non-diabetic Patients of a Semaglutide-Supported Digital Obesity Program in the UK: A Comparative Retrospective Cohort Study](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67d064eb431f6062e0a1b1c800e6b9f6d82ac84b)

Digital weight-loss services (DWLSs) that supplement continuous lifestyle coaching with semaglutide therapy have shown promise in delivering continuous and effective obesity care. However, the extent to which lifestyle coaching design influences patient engagement and program effectiveness is unknown. This study retrospectively analysed several engagement markers and weight loss percentage over 16 weeks in a large semaglutide-supported DWLS in the UK (n=154). The comparative analysis found that patients who received lifestyle coaching that was proactive and personalised sent a statistically higher number of messages to their health coach (Mean=19.37 vs Mean=8.55) and opened the program app more frequently (Mean = 49.31 days vs Mean = 40.06 days) than patients whose coaching was reactive and standardised. Mean 16-week weight loss was 10.1% in the proactive group compared to 8.9% in the reactive group, but the difference was not statistically significant. A two-sample t-test found that female patients (Mean = 9.76%) tended to lose more weight than male patients (Mean = 6.88%), (t(152) = 1.89, p = 0.04). The findings add vital layers of nuance to the emerging literature on semaglutide-supported DWLSs, indicating that a proactive, personalised coaching approach leads to better patient engagement, but that such engagement is not correlated with better short-term weight-loss or program adherence outcomes. Moreover, the cohort’s comparably higher mean weight loss relative to previous real-world semaglutide studies lend support to the advice of leading global health institutions of using the medication only as an adjunct to multidisciplinary lifestyle therapy. Investigators should expand on this research by conducting comparable studies over a longer period and with medication-only control groups.

6. [Cost–Consequence Analysis of Semaglutide vs. Liraglutide for Managing Obese Prediabetic and Diabetic Patients in Saudi Arabia: A Single-Center Study](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e6722a96a6feb96b58146ded1df6765cdd79d6f)

Background: Semaglutide and Liraglutide are medications in the Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1 RAs) class used to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity in Saudi Arabia. Although the 1.0 mg once weekly dosage of Semaglutide does not have a labeled indication for the management of obesity, many believe that this dosage is more effective than the 3.0 mg once daily Liraglutide dosage for the management of both diabetes and obesity. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of the dosage of 1.0 mg of Semaglutide administered once weekly versus 3.0 mg of Liraglutide administered once daily in controlling HbA1c levels, promoting weight loss, and evaluating their financial implications among obese patients in Saudi Arabia using real-world data. Methods: A retrospective review of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) from January 2021 to June 2024 was conducted on patients prescribed Semaglutide or Liraglutide for at least 12 months. Exclusion criteria included pre-existing severe conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, stroke, or cancer) and missing baseline data. The primary outcomes assessed were changes in HbA1c, weight, and direct medical costs. Results: Two hundred patients (100 patients on the 1.0 mg once weekly dose of Semaglutide and 100 patients on the 3.0 mg once daily dose of Liraglutide) of those randomly selected from the EMRs met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Of the 200 eligible patients (65.5% female, mean age 48.54 years), weight loss was greater with Semaglutide (−8.09 kg) than Liraglutide (−5.884 kg). HbA1c reduction was also greater with Semaglutide (−1.073%) than Liraglutide (−0.298%). The use of Semaglutide resulted in lower costs of USD −1264.76 (95% CI: −1826.82 to 33.76) and greater reductions in weight of −2.22 KG (95% CI: −7.68 to −2.784), as well as lower costs of USD −1264.76 (95% CI: (−2368.16 to −239.686) and greater reductions in HbA1c of −0.77% (95% CI: −0.923 to −0.0971) in more than 95% of the cost effectiveness bootstrap distributions. Conclusions: Semaglutide 1.0 mg weekly seems to be more effective and cost-saving in managing prediabetes, diabetes, and obesity compared to Liraglutide 3.0 mg daily. Future studies should examine these findings using a more representative sample and a robust study design.

Background Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors effectively reduce LDL cholesterol and adverse cardiovascular events with a safety profile comparable to a placebo. Limited real-world data exists on their effectiveness in different patient groups. This study evaluated evolocumab’s efficacy and safety in hypercholesteremia patients with and without diabetes. Method In a large tertiary hospital in Saudi Arabia, patients aged 18 and above who initiated evolocumab therapy were screened for eligibility between January 2017 and July 2023. All patients who had been on maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy for at least 4 months before starting evolocumab were included. The included participants were then divided into diabetic and non-diabetic groups and assessed for evolocumab’s efficacy and safety. Efficacy was measured by LDL-C reduction and target achievement, while safety was assessed by examining glycemic control changes, new-onset diabetes (NOD) and hepatic enzyme levels. Data analysis included descriptive and comparative methods, with significance set at p < 0.05. Results A total of 151 patients were included, with an average age of 51.77 years. The majority of patients were male (67.6%) and obese (81.5%). Around 55% had diabetes, and 63% had established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at baseline. During a mean follow-up period of 13.17 months, the average reduction in LDL-C from baseline was − 34.21, − 28.66, and − 39.61% for the overall cohort, non-diabetic patients, and diabetic patients, respectively. In the overall cohort, 24.5 and 34.4% reached the target LDL-C levels of less than 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL) and less than 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL), respectively. Worsening of glycemic control (HbA1C increase > 0.5) was observed in 25.83% of the overall cohort, 16.18% of non-diabetics, and 33.74% of diabetics. An HbA1C increase > 1 was observed in 13.25% of the overall cohort, 2.94% in non-diabetics and 21.69% in diabetics. Five patients (3.3%) developed NOD. Conclusion The study demonstrated that the addition of evolocumab to maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy reduced LDL-C levels but with a smaller average reduction and a lower proportion of patients achieving recommended LDL-C targets than in landmark clinical trials. Additionally, there was a potential negative effect on glycemic control, warranting further investigation.

8. [Effectiveness of dulaglutide in the real world and in special populations of type 2 diabetic patients.](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9f3f43f146d6b73f863c40478ad8385c39c4a060)
Date published: 2020

CONTEXT
In randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients, the GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-RA) dulaglutide reduced HbA1c and body weight, but generalizability of such findings to real-world T2D patients is challenging.


OBJECTIVE
We evaluated effectiveness of dulaglutide in routine clinical practice, especially in subgroups of patient that are under-represented in RCTs.


DESIGN
Retrospective multicenter study.


SETTING
Diabetes outpatient clinics.


PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION
All consecutive patients who initiated dulaglutide between 2015 and 2018.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Changes in HbA1c and body weight were assessed up to 30 months after baseline. Effectiveness was analyzed in patient subgroups according to: prior use of GLP-1RA, persistence on treatment and dose, age, sex, disease duration, renal function, obesity, cardiovascular disease, concomitant use of insulin or sulphonylurea.


RESULTS
From a background population of 83,116 patients, 2084 initiated dulaglutide (15.3% switching from another GLP-1RA), 1307 of whom had at least one follow-up visit. Overall, dulaglutide reduced HbA1c by 1.0% and body weight by 2.9 kg at the end of observation. These effects were more pronounced in GLP-1RA-naïve patients and in those with shorter disease duration. Improvement in HbA1c was highly significant and consistent across all subgroups, including those aged ≥75 years, non-obese, or with chronic kidney disease. Body weight declined in all subgroups and significantly more with the 1.5 mg versus 0.75 mg dose.


CONCLUSIONS
In real-world T2D patients, effectiveness of dulaglutide on HbA1c and body weight reduction was highly consistent and significant even in subgroups of patients poorly represented in RCTs.

9. [Effectiveness of Semaglutide and Tirzepatide in Overweight and Obese Adults with Type 1 Diabetes.](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0833f7feb8f708a28ca2cffeb1ecfee19fe88f6d)
Date published: 2025
Source: Semantic Scholar

Objective: Adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are increasingly overweight or obese, in part due to intensive insulin therapy. Newer non-insulin medications targeting both hyperglycemia and weight loss are approved for people with type 2 diabetes. These drugs also reduce cardiovascular disease, the major cause of mortality in people with diabetes. We assessed the real-world use of semaglutide and tirzepatide, in adults with T1D followed in a specialty diabetes clinic. Materials and Methods: This retrospective chart review included 100 adults who were prescribed semaglutide or tirzepatide (50 each) and 50 controls frequency matched for age, sex, diabetes duration, body mass index, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and who did not receive any weight loss medications during the study period. Data were collected prior to initiation of weight loss medications (baseline) and then for up to 1 year for each patient. Results: Matching characteristics did not differ between cases and controls. There were declines in weight in both semaglutide (-19.2 ± standard error (SE) 2.9 lbs. [9.1% body weight lost]) and tirzepatide (-49.4 ± SE 3.0 lbs. [21.4% body weight lost]) groups, and HbA1c decreased in both semaglutide (-0.54 ± SE 0.14%, P = 0.0001) and tirzepatide users (-0.68 ± SE 0.16%, P < 0.0001) over 12 months. Weight and HbA1c didn't change in controls. Conclusions: We observed weight loss of 9.1% and 21.4% and improved glucose control in semaglutide and tirzepatide users, respectively, after 1 year of off-label use. As off-label use of these drugs is increasing in patients with T1D, larger, prospective safety and efficacy trials are needed.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a common and major complication of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Anti-diabetic therapy aims to lower blood glucose, with primary clinical trial endpoints for new antidiabetic entrants focused on HbA1c. Research suggests some glucose-lowering drugs, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), can have a cardioprotective effect in people with T2D.1,2
 
 
 
 To compare the real-world risk of major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) in people with T2D treated with GLP-1 RAs compared to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors or basal insulin.
 
 
 
 We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum, secondary care Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics death registrations. We included patients aged ≥18 years with T2D at high-risk or very-high-risk of CVD (as defined by the European Society of Cardiology) who had ≥2 prescriptions of either GLP-1 RA (dulaglutide, liraglutide, and semaglutide), DPP-4 inhibitor (as part of line 4 therapy) or basal insulin from 01/01/2014-31/12/2018. We excluded those pregnant at therapy initiation or with type 1 diabetes. Follow-up started at second prescription of relevant therapy and ended at the earliest of two years later, pregnancy, death, end of primary care record, or 31/12/2019. We used data from patients’ medical histories to define baseline characteristics. We calculated the incidence of MACE per 100,000 person-years (PY), defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death. We used Cox proportional hazards regression, using LASSO to select confounding clinical variables including BMI, prior MACE and intercurrent antidiabetic treatments, to estimate risk difference of MACE among those treated with 1) GLP1-RA and DPP-4 inhibitor and 2) GLP1-RA and basal insulin.
 
 
 
 We included 63,237 patients, among whom the patients treated with GLP1-RA were younger and a higher proportion were obese or severely obese than those treated with DPP-4 inhibitor or basal insulin (Table 1). The incidence of MACE was highest in those treated with DPP-4 inhibitor (high-risk 1,503.0/100,000 PY; very-high-risk 6,000.7/100,000 PY) followed by basal insulin (high-risk 1,396.9/100,000 PY; very-high-risk 5,707.1/100,000 PY), and lowest in those treated with GLP1-RA (high-risk 377.1/100,000 PY; very-high-risk 1,946.1/100,000 PY). After adjustment, the risk of MACE among patients treated with GLP1-RA was still significantly lower than those treated with either DPP-4 inhibitor (high-risk aHR: 0.42, 95% CI 0.21-0.86 and very-high-risk aHR: 0.65, 95% CI 0.58-0.73) or those treated with basal insulin (high-risk aHR: 0.36, 95% CI 0.18-0.72 and very-high-risk aHR: 0.72, 95% CI 0.64-0.81).
 
 
 
 Our study supports clinical trial and other observational research studies which find a cardioprotective effect of GLP-1 RA use in people with T2D.
