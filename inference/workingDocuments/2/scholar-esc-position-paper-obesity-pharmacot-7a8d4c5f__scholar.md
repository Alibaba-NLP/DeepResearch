The progress in pharmacotherapy that has been made in recent years, including the introduction of very effective and safe lipid-lowering and antihypertensive drugs, has not yet translated into the expected universal control of blood pressure, lipid disorders and diabetes. In the STRUGGLE FOR Italian-Polish-Spanish-Uzbek-Vietnamese Expert Forum Position Paper 2023, experts from five countries recounted several points about the paradigms of cardiological and cardiometabolic care for better control of classical modifiable risk factors in the year 2023. It is believed herein, that the need to intensify treatment, actively search for patients with cardiovascular risk factors, especially with arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, should go hand in hand with the implementation of the latest therapy, based on single pill combinations including proven, effective antihypertensive, lipid-lowering and antidiabetic molecules, many of which are listed in the present document. There is a need to use both new technological concepts, completely new drugs, as well as novel treatment concepts such as metabolic treatment in coronary artery disease, try to intensify the fight against smoking in every way, including the available range of drugs and procedures reducing the harm. This approach will provide substantially better control of the underlying cardiovascular risk factors in countries as varied as Italy, Poland, Spain, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.

Obesity or Adiposity is a worldwide common health problem that is related with an augmented risk of a number of medical conditions, morbidity and mortality. This mini review recapitulates the epidemiology, Etiology, associated comorbidities, biomarkers and available pharmacotherapy of obesity. The epidemiology of obesity is increasing in low-, middle- and high-income countries, with sociodemographic, behavioural, and genetic factors all playing a role. Comorbidities include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, coronary artery disease, and melanoma. Biomarkers associated with obesity include anthropometric markers, biochemical markers, hormonal markers, molecular biomarkers. Obesity related Oxidative stress is also discussed in this paper as per current findings from various clinical and preclinical data available up to January 2023.Treatment approaches range from lifestyle changes to pharmacotherapy and surgery. The available pharmacotherapy is either connected with precarious ill effects or overpriced, therefore, alternative therapies for obesity attenuation are required. Article under discussion provides an insight into oxidative stress attenuation, gene therapy via biomarkers regulation for combating obesity. Prevention strategies should include multidimensional approaches tailored to each nation

Abstract Problem The Climate & Health Alliance (CHA) is a coalition of medical, health and advocacy organisations that seeks to highlight the significant health co-benefits of addressing the climate crisis. Our global food system contributes to diet-related chronic disease and has resulted in climate change, pollution, biodiversity collapse and nature loss. A healthy sustainable food system is needed to minimise interrelated obesity, climate change and malnutrition pandemics. Description of the problem The CHA conducted an extensive literature review to: 1. Demonstrate the need for a food system transition ; 2. Identify Ireland's challenge areas ; 3. Make recommendations for a healthy sustainable diet in the Irish context; 4. Recommend policy-level actions for Ireland. The CHA launched ‘Fixing Food Together’ in May 2023. We identified six challenge areas for Ireland: 1. Ending the junk food cycle; 2. Promoting transition to a more plant-based diet; 3. Harnessing the power of international and national guidelines; 4. Reducing food waste; 5. Improving agricultural practices and land use; 6. Using policy to affect behaviour change. Results The CHA presented individual-level recommendations for future Irish dietary guidelines, including breastfeeding, ultra-processed foods, protein foods and food waste. Seven policy recommendations were made: 1. National guidelines; 2. Regulations/laws; 3. Research, processing and technology actions; 4. Financial actions ; 5. Agricultural actions; 6. Public institution actions; 7. Public awareness actions Lessons ‘Fixing Food Together’ represents the first time a healthy sustainable diet and food system has been defined for an Irish context. The cross-sectional nature of the alliance provides a valuable consensus from its member organisations. It brings an often missing public health perspective to the climate and food systems dialogue. Key messages • Our current food system is harming human and planetary health. • ‘Fixing Food Together’ identifies Ireland’s challenge areas and makes recommendations to transition to a healthy sustainable food system.

In patients with ‘myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries’ (MINOCA), the underlying cause is not always known. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) is recommended as a key investigation in MINOCA because it can exclude myocarditis, takotsubo syndrome, and cardiomyopathies, as well as provide imaging confirmation of AMI. However, CMRI is not widely available. The aim of our study was to analyze the role of CMRI in patients with MINOCA in routine clinical practice in a non-tertiary hospital of the Spanish national health system.
 
 
 
 We analyzed 62 consecutive MINOCA patients admitted to our University Hospital from 2019 to January 2023. The database were revised by a group of experts in order to adequate MINOCA to 2020 ESC Guidelines definition and the American Heart Association position paper. The tako-tsubo syndrome was excluded. According to these guidelines CMRI is recommended in the evaluation of MINOCA patients.
 
 
 
 Only in 32 patients, corresponding to 52% of the patients with MINOCA, the CMRI was performed because of the limited availability of this test in our health System. Of the CMRI performed, 46% provided the underlying mechanism of the MINOCA: myocarditis (21%) or confirmation of AMI (25%). The other CMRI were normal (54%) (figure). Although patients with normal CMRI had a significantly lower mean TropT hs (236.02 vs 794.02 ng/L, p=0.03), troponin levels were not able to discriminate patients with normal CMRI. Thus up to 33% of patients with pathological CMRI had a TropThs level less than 244 ng/L (which was the median of the series).
 There were no significant differences in other biomarkers (PCR, CK) or clinical or analytical parameters. There were also no differences in prognosis at follow-up (death or readmissions) between patients with normal CMRI and patients with diagnostic CMRI.
 
 
 
 1) In routine clinical practice, only 52% of patients with MINOCA underwent CMRI, 2) Of the patients who underwent CMRI, it provided the underlying mechanism of the MINOCA in 46% of them, 3) Although the TropThs level was lower in patients with normal CMRI, the troponin level was not useful to select the patients that would benefit most from such a test.CMRI in MINOCA patients

The 2024 guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) refer to four very important therapeutic areas: arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic coronary syndromes and peripheral artery disease. The ESC countries and their institutional members share a common goal of reducing the burden of cardiovascular diseases, which remain the leading cause of death worldwide. Experts from these six countries — three from Europe and three from Asia — gathered at the annual meeting to briefly present the epidemiological situation regarding selected issues addressed in the 2024 ESC guidelines, and to create a document highlighting the significant progress in pharmacotherapy. The new guidelines allow us to identify particularly important therapeutic areas and unmet pharmaceutical needs within the four treatment guidelines developed by the ESC in 2024. While discussing each of these four documents, 10 subjectively selected points were chosen to highlight what should be kept in mind in daily clinical practice. Altogether, a range of all-risk categories are represented, and the observations made in this position paper are of a universal nature.

The tandem issue of obesity and overweight is a serious global issue that has attained pandemic
scale. Media, particularly advertising, plays an active role in shaping perceptions and behavioural
patterns, influencing both how and what people eat. This paper analyses food advertising in Serbia in 2023 in the context of promoting dietary habits. Content analysis of commercials aired on a selection of television stations during the year showed the overwhelming prevalence of ads for food high in fat, sugar, and salt (HFSS), with confectionary products in lead positions. Commercial narratives centre on framing them as sources or catalysts for joyful, fun, and playful experiences. They encourage increased consumption, snacking outside regular mealtimes, and position HFSS foods as essential components to make meals feel complete.

Emerging endoscopic strategies are revolutionizing the treatment of obesity by offering a less invasive alternative to traditional bariatric surgery. Conventional approaches, including lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy, often result in only moderate weight loss, while surgical interventions, despite their high efficacy, carry a significant risk of short- and long-term complications. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of current endoscopic modalities, such as various intragastric balloons (Orbera, ReShape, Obalon, Spatz3, Ellipse, Heliosphere), endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty, aspiration therapies, and duodenal–jejunal bypass sleeves. These techniques work by reducing gastric volume, modulating gut hormone secretion, and delaying gastric emptying, thereby enhancing satiety and promoting sustained weight loss. The review emphasizes that while early results are promising, demonstrating significant weight reduction and metabolic improvements with lower complication rates than surgical methods, further long-term studies are required to fully establish their efficacy and safety profile. Endoscopic bariatric interventions are positioned as a valuable addition to the obesity treatment armamentarium, particularly for patients who are not ideal candidates for surgery or who seek reversible treatment options.
