Dear Colleagues!We are glad to present the 11th Edition of the Standards of Specialized Diabetes Care. These evidence-based guidelines were designed to standardize and facilitate diabetes care in all regions of the Russian Federation.The Standards are updated on the regular basis to incorporate new data and relevant recommendations from national and international clinical societies, including World Health Organization Guidelines (WHO), International Diabetes Federation (IDF), European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), American Diabetes Association (ADA), American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) and Russian Association of Endocrinologists (RAE). Current edition of the “Standards” also integrates results of completed randomized clinical trials, as well as findings from the national studies of diabetes mellitus (DM), conducted in close partnership with a number of Russian hospitals.Latest data indicates that prevalence of DM in the world increased during the last decade more than two-fold, reaching some 537 million patients by the end of 2021. According to the current estimation by the International Diabetes Federation, 643 million patients will be suffering from DM by 2030 and 783 million by 2045.Like many other countries, Russian Federation experiences a sharp rise in the prevalence of DM. According to Russian Federal Diabetes Register, there are at least 4 962 762 patients with DM in this country on 01.01.2023 (3,42% of population) with 92,3% (4 581 990) – Type 2 DM, 5,6% (277 092) – Type 1 DM and 2,1% (103 680) – other types of DM, including 8 758 women with gestational DM. However, these results underestimate real quantity of patients, because they consider only registered cases. Results of Russian epidemiological study (NATION) confirmed that 54% of patients with Type 2 DM are undiagnosed. So real number of patients with DM in Russia is 11-12 million patients (about 7% of population). This is a great long-term problem, because a lot of patients are not diagnosed, so they don’t receive any treatment and have high risk of vascular complications.Severe consequences of the global pandemic of DM include its vascular complications: nephropathy, retinopathy, coronary, cerebral and peripheral vascular disease. These conditions are responsible for the majority of cases of diabetes-related disability and death.In accordance with the Federal Law № 489-FZ of 25.12.2018 medical care should be provided on the basis of the clinical recommendations. Therefore, clinical recommendations posted in the rubricator of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation (https://cr.minzdrav.gov.ru) being the priority.This edition of the Algorithms for Specialized Care for Patients with Diabetes Mellitus contains the main information from the clinical guidelines for the management of diabetes mellitus in adults and children (“Type 1 Diabetes in Children (2022)”, “Type 1 Diabetes in Adults (2022)”, “Type 2 diabetes mellitus in children (2021)”, “Type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults (2022)”), as well as the updated data.New information has been added about indications for using of antihyperglycemic drugs and their instructional restrictions; algorithm of treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus has been updated; clarifications have been made on the range of glycemic control in pregnant women; information on the treatment of diabetic complications and the management of pediatric patients has been added. In 2023, Russian diabetology suffered an unbearable loss - Alexander Yuryevich Mayorov, who was the executive editor of the previous issues and an active participant of the work on all the previous editions of “Algorithms” from the moment they were founded, passed away. This publication is dedicated to the memory of Alexander Yuryevich, who was an example of the service to patients and medicine, a friend, teacher, mentor, generously sharing his knowledge and the sample of the execution of the medical duty to all of us. On behalf of the Working Group

Abstract Disclosure: A.M. Chakraborty: None. R. Waila: None. S. Bhansali: None. H. Bhujade: None. N. Sachdeva: None. S. Bhadada: None. Introduction: The usual perception and interpretation of diabetes mellitus is that of an irreversible and chronic persistent disease with little scope for remission. Following the success of metabolic surgery and intensive lifestyle modification, it is time for pharmacotherapy to sept in. Methodology: It was a single-center, randomized controlled trial conducted in patients having HbA1c below 9 % at randomization and having a duration of diabetes less than 2 years. Patients with organ-threatening chronic diseases and severe diabetes-related complications have been excluded. Study populations have been randomized to 1:1 to receive pharmacotherapy with oral semaglutide, dapagliflozin, and metformin in one arm and vildagliptin, metformin, and titrated glimepiride in the control arm. Duration of therapy was 6 months including 2 months of up titration of semaglutide. Patients have been followed up for 3 months after stopping all therapy following 6 months of therapy. The primary outcome was to find out the remission rates in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with a combination of oral Semaglutide and dapagliflozin on top of metformin monotherapy and to compare with the standard diabetes practice. The secondary outcome was to assess the anthropometric change and change in beta cell function parameters with a mixed meal tolerance test. Results: A total of 38 patients have completed therapy, 17 were in the trial arm and 21 in the control arm. Among 17 patients in the trial arm, all the patients were in remission as per the prespecified criteria. Among the patients who completed 6 months of follow-up (n-13), 11 patients (84%) maintained remission in the trial arm. The remission rate was 100% in the trial arm and 48% in the conventional arm (p<0.001) after 3 months and 84% and 27.7% in the trial arm and conventional arm respectively after 6 months of follow-up (p<0.05). Reduction in BMI (p <0.001) and percent body fat (p<0.01) and increase in disposition index after mixed meal tolerance test (p<0.01) was statistically related to remission. Conclusion: Remission of diabetes as defined by ADA in the consensus statement (HbA1c < 6.5 % without glucose-lowering therapy for at least 3 months) is a reality. It can be achieved by pharmacotherapy targeting body weight and adiposity. The main predictors of remission were a reduction of BMI and body fat and an increased disposition Index. Since it is an ongoing study, further follow-up is planned to determine the continuation of the remission phase among those who achieved remission with pharmacotherapy. Presentation: 6/3/2024

Introduction:
 Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) indicated to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with Type 2Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and established cardiovascular disease (CVD). Tirzepatide is a novel GLP-1RA/GIP for the same purpose. Adding either agent to the standard of care may impose a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Therefore, we compared their value for money for this indication in patients over 65.
 
 
 Hypothesis:
 Tirzepatide provides better value for money than semaglutide in reducing MACE in this age group.
 
 
 Methods:
 We calculated the cost needed to prevent one MACE with either drug by multiplying the annualized number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one event by the annual cost of the therapy. Efficacy estimates were extracted from pre-specified subgroups of patients over 65 in relevant published randomized controlled trials. US drug costs were based on GoodRx prices as of June 2022.
 
 
 Results:
 The annualized NNT to prevent one MACE in patients over 65 with tirzepatide in SURPASS was 58 (95% CI: 36-∞) compared to 79 (95% CI: 45-∞) with semaglutide in SUSTAIN-6. The annual cost of tirzepatide is $12,678 versus $11,616 for semaglutide. Accordingly, the CNT to prevent one MACE with tirzepatide is $735,308 (95% CI: $456,398-∞) compared to $917,635 (95% CI: $522,703-∞) with semaglutide.
 
 
 Conclusions:
 Tirzepatide prescribed for secondary prevention of MACE in patients over 65 with T2DM and established CVD provides better value than semaglutide for the same purpose.

Value-based healthcare (VBC) represents one strategy to meet growing challenges in healthcare systems. To date, VBC is not implemented broadly in the German healthcare system. A Delphi survey was conducted to explore stakeholders’ perspectives on the relevance and feasibility of actions and practices related to the implementation of VBC in the German healthcare system. Panellists were selected using purposive sampling. Two iterative online survey rounds were conducted which were preceded by a literature search and semi-structured interviews. After two survey rounds, a consensus was reached on 95% of the items in terms of relevance and on 89% of the items regarding feasibility. The expert panels’ responses were in favor of the presented actions and practices of VBC in 98% of items for which consensus was found (n = 101). Opposition was present regarding the relevance of health care being provided preferably in one location for each indication. Additionally, the panel considered inter-sectoral joint budgets contingent on treatment outcomes achieved as not feasible. When planning the next steps in moving towards a value-based healthcare system, policymakers should take into account this study’s results on stakeholders’ perceptions of the relative importance and feasibility of VBC components. This ensures that regulatory changes are aligned with stakeholder values, facilitating greater acceptance and more successful implementation.

Date published: 2024

Introduction and Objective: Several GLP-1 drugs are FDA approved for type 2 diabetes (T2D) or obesity. The 2024 ADA standards of care highlight that for individuals with T2D and obesity/overweight, GLP-1 therapy is preferred. While many adults with T1D are overweight/obese, GLP-1 use in this population is not well characterized. Data from the T1D Exchange Online Registry was leveraged to assess self-reported GLP-1 use by demographic and clinical characteristics.
 Methods: Registry participants complete questionnaires annually. This analysis includes T1D adults who completed a questionnaire in 2023.
 Results: Among 8,053 adults, 470 (5.8%) reported using a GLP-1, % using GLP-1 by characteristics are shown in the Table. Median HbA1c was similar in those using (6.6%) and not using (6.5%) GLP-1. GLP-1 use was more common in adults with obesity and cardiovascular disease and less common among those with severe hypoglycemia. Among those with known GLP-1 type (n=109), 67% used semaglutide, 16% tirzepatide, 10% dulaglutide, 6% liraglutide and 1% exenatide.
 Conclusion: GLP-1 use in this cohort of adults with T1D is low despite increasing prevalence of obesity. With increased focus on treatment of obesity, trends of GLP-1 use in those with T1D may change over time. Considering the benefits of these agents, further prospective research focused on this population is needed.

Diabetes Care ’s editorial committee customarily presents a midyear report of activities and progress. At the midpoint of 2018 we can describe, in addition to a satisfying array of original scientific reports, important feature articles of current interest and a significant new initiative.

In the first half of this year, the journal published several feature articles related to our core responsibility as a journal representing the American Diabetes Association (ADA). An update to the ADA’s “Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes” (Standards of Care [SOC]) appeared as a supplement to the January issue (1). The SOC is prepared by the Professional Practice Committee of the ADA and contains guidance on various aspects of care of those with or at risk for diabetes, together with summaries of published data supporting these statements. Because scientific information is accumulating faster than ever before, the ADA announced a new policy in the March 2018 issue (2). The yearly January supplement to Diabetes Care will continue as before, but the SOC will now be updated more frequently. The ADA now uses a web annotation tool to update and revise the online version throughout the year, whenever new evidence or regulatory changes merit immediate incorporation. Already in 2018 new information has been added regarding two medications recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (semaglutide and ertugliflozin) and an update on the definitions of hypoglycemia. Changes of this kind will be communicated by the ADA through its print, online, and social media channels.

Additional consensus statements and commentaries on new or controversial topics will continue to appear in Diabetes Care . Unlike the SOC, they are not official guidance statements but generally reflect the ADA’s thinking. For example, a joint statement by representatives of the ADA and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes …

Systematic evaluation of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) outcomes is essential to improve clinical practice and meet international quality standards. In Brazil, the partnership between the Brazilian Society of Cellular Therapy and Bone Marrow Transplantation (SBTMO) and the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) has advanced national data reporting and benchmarking through the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Brazilian Registry (HCTBR). This study reports outcomes from 11,210 first HCTs (5,984 allogeneic; 5,226 autologous) performed between 2012 and 2023 across 44 Brazilian centers. 
Median recipient age was 29 years for allogeneic and 53 years for autologous transplants. Acute leukemias predominated among allogeneic cases, while multiple myeloma was the most common indication for autologous HCT. Two-year overall survival was 82.0% for autologous and 59.8% for allogeneic transplants, with variation by donor type (matched related 61.8%, mismatched related 54.0%, unrelated 63.3%). Two-year non-relapse mortality was 8.0% and 21.6% for autologous and allogeneic transplants, respectively. The cumulative incidence of grade II–IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at two years was 29.9%, with chronic GVHD incidence of 29.5%. Two-year relapse incidence was 24.1% for allogeneic and 25.8% for autologous HCT. 
Despite challenges within the Brazilian healthcare system, these outcomes align with international registry data. Adequate data completeness supports the robustness of these findings. Our results highlight the quality of Brazilian transplant programs and underscore the value of standardized outcome monitoring to foster continuous improvement. Strengthening center participation, follow-up, and data management remains critical to maintaining registry quality and enhancing patient care.
