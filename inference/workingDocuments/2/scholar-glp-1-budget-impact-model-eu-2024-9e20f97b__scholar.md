Introduction: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are widely used oral anti-diabetic agents with increasing use for the management of obesity. Emerging literature suggests that GLP-1 RA may be associated with high gastric residue in the esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and potentially a ﬀ ect bowel preparation before a colonoscopy. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the in ﬂ uence of GLP-1 RA on the endoscopic procedures. Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature using Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases from inception to March 2024 to identify studies evaluating the e ﬀ ect of GLP-1 RA on EGD and bowel preparation for colonoscopy. We selected studies comparing gastric residue, satisfactory bowel preparation (Boston Bowel Preparation Scale, BBPS . 5) and mean BBPS scores between GLP-1 RA users versus non-users. Hedges ’ g test was used to calculate the standardized mean di ﬀ erence of BBPS between the 2 groups. Random e ﬀ ects model was used and analysis was performed with STATA 17. Results: Eight observational studies were included in the ﬁ nal analyses. The majority of the patients were diabetics. Five studies assessed the association between GLP-1 RA use and gastric residue. Overall, pooled analysis showed a higher risk for gastric retention of solid contents with GLP-1 RA use (OR: 4.35; 95% CI: 2.81-6.74, I 2 5 0, Figure 1). Three studies reported 2 pulmonary aspiration events in GLP-1 RA users. Furthermore, 3 studies assessed the e ﬀ ect of GLP-1 RA use on bowel preparation before colonoscopy

2. [An Economic Analysis Assessing the Budget Impact of Introducing Glofitamab with Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant-Ineligible Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma to a United States Health Plan](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3641d02de49926bbe4ac743a15a8dfe2625d004)

Background:
 The Phase III STARGLO trial (GO41944; NCT04408638) that evaluated glofitamab with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (Glofit-GemOx) versus (vs) rituximab with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx), met its primary endpoint of overall survival. The study enrolled patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who had previously received 1 line of therapy (LoT) and were not candidates for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT-ineligible) or had previously received ≥2 LoT. We conducted an economic analysis to assess the total cost of care among second-line (2L)+ treatment options and the budget impact of introducing Glofit-GemOx as a treatment for ASCT-ineligible R/R DLBCL to a US health plan.
 Methods:
 A 3-year budget impact model was developed for a hypothetical cohort of 1 million individuals enrolled in a mixed commercial/Medicare health plan. We used age distributions from US census data for insured individuals and assumed pts <65 years had commercial coverage and pts ≥65 years had Medicare coverage. Comparators were axicabtagene ciloleucel (Axi-cel), lisocabtagene maraleucel (Liso-cel), tisagenlecleucel (Tisa-cel), loncastuximab tesirine (Lonca), polatuzumab vedotin + bendamustine + rituximab (Pola-BR), rituximab-based chemotherapy (R-Chemo), tafasitamab + lenalidomide (Tafa-Len), epcoritamab, and glofitamab monotherapy. R-GemOx represented the average cost of R-Chemo. DLBCL incidence rates were sourced from the SEER database (22 registries, November 2022) and the proportion of pts who received first-line, 2L, and third-line treatment were derived from projected incidence rates based on physician surveys (Kanas et al. Leuk Lymphoma 2022). Total costs included drug and administration based on treatment duration observed in pivotal trials, management of grade 3+ adverse events (AEs) occurring in ≥5% of pts in any regimen, cytokine release syndrome monitoring and routine care. Median treatment durations were converted to means using published methods (Hozo et al. BMC Med Res Methodol 2005) and the mean durations for all therapies were under 1 year, except Tafa-Len. Drug costs were sourced from the average wholesale acquisition cost reported in AnalySource® (2024) or Medicare Average Sales Price (Q2 2024). All other costs were inflated to 2024 US dollars, where applicable, and were based on published US sources. Market share projections were based on internal projections and expert opinion. AE incidence rates were sourced from each regimens' US package insert or pivotal trial. Budget impact was presented as total cumulative costs and average per-member per-month (PMPM) costs. Net budget impact was the difference in costs between the projected scenario with Glofit-GemOx and the current scenario without Glofit-GemOx. One-way sensitivity analyses (OWSA) varied inputs by ±20% to test the robustness of model results.
 Results:
 Of the 1 million individuals in a health plan, approximately 16 were projected to be eligible annually for treatment of R/R DLBCL after 1 LoT and ASCT-ineligible, or after ≥2 LoT. Over the model time horizon, the total cost per treated patient among the T-cell engaging treatment options was lowest for glofitamab monotherapy and Glofit-GemOx (Glofit = $226,360, Glofit-GemOx = $269,096, epcoritamab = $345,633, Liso-cel = $543,355, Axi-Cel = $549,621, Tisa-cel = $567,350; other treatments: R-Chemo = $38,528, Pola-BR = $146,637, Lonca = $219,304, Tafa-Len = $390,426). Over 3 years, the addition of Glofit-GemOx resulted in an estimated cumulative budget impact of $1,026,768 ($16,121,302 with Glofit-GemOx vs $15,094,533 without); the PMPM net budget impact was $0.0285. In the OWSA, the most influential inputs were the ASCT-ineligible proportion, the population distribution by age group, and the incidence of 2L treatment, varying the budget impact from 0.0228 to 0.0342 PMPM.
 Conclusions:
 The addition of Glofit-GemOx for the treatment of R/R DLBCL after 1 LoT and ASCT-ineligible or after ≥2 LoT to a US payer formulary is projected to result in a minimal budget impact of $0.0285 PMPM over 3 years. The estimated cumulative per-patient cost of Glofit-GemOx is projected to be lower than the per-patient costs of other available T-cell engaging treatment, including epcoritamab and the CAR-T therapies. The OWSA found that the model results were robust, and most sensitive to the ASCT-ineligible proportion.

Abstract Disclosure: P. Panjawatanan: None. N. Radovanovic: None. R.J. Comi: None. Introduction: Insulin therapy is the mainstream treatment in patients with Type 1 diabetes. The use of insulin, though mimicking normal physiology, is associated with weight gain. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists are a class of antidiabetic medication that lowers blood sugar levels and helps promote weight loss. We propose that GLP-1 agonists can reverse the trend of weight gain and help lower hemoglobin A1C (A1C) levels in patients with Type 1 diabetes who were gaining weight. Method: A retrospective chart review was performed at a single institution’s endocrine practice over five years. Patients with Type 1 diabetes with concomitant GLP-1 agonists used for at least one year were included. Observed outcomes were the change in A1C, weight, and basal insulin use compared at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months using mixed models repeated measures. The result was reported as estimated means (95%CI). Statistical significance was determined by a p-value less than 0.05. Results: There were 49 patients included in the study. The mean age was 44.7 years old. There were 32 females (65.3%) and 17 males (34.7%). The mean duration of diabetes was 24.6 years. Thirty-five patients (71.4%) used insulin pumps, and fourteen (28.6%) were on multiple daily injections. Overall, patients had been gaining an average of 2.0 kg per year. After the treatment with GLP-1 agonists, weight was significantly reduced at 12 months (90.0 kg (95%CI 84.9-95.1), p<0.001) compared to baseline (97.6 kg (95%CI 92.7-102.5)). The A1C was significantly improved at 12 months (7.6% (95%CI 7.2-7.9), p<0.001) compared to the baseline (8.2% (95%CI 7.9-8.6)). Total daily basal dose was significantly reduced at 12 months (35.8 units (95%CI 29.8-41.9), p<0.001) compared to the baseline (39.2 units (95%CI 33.3-45.1)). The improvement in the parameters was more pronounced at 6 months after treatment but persisted at 12 months. Conclusion: Weight gain is a consequence of insulin usage in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, which considerably impacts treatment outcomes and the development of comorbidities. We conclude that GLP-1 agonists are helpful to reverse the trend of weight gain and help lower A1C levels in patients with Type 1 diabetes who require life-long insulin treatment.

Abstract The aim of the article is, firstly, to present and evaluate the legal model of financing agricultural activities in Poland following Poland’s accession to the EU in the face of current challenges, and secondly, to attempt to determine the tasks that the Agency for the Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture performs in financing agricultural activities from EU funds. The article presents the System of Direct Payments as a basic element of Pillar I of the Common Agricultural Policy, Pillar II of the Common Agricultural Policy, Extraordinary Financial Support, the Agency for the Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture in Poland as an accredited entity implementing instruments co-financed from the European Union budget, de mininis aid, notified and ratified programmes. In conclusion, the author states that the current financial support through differentiated programmes under CAP 2023–2027 is aimed at meeting the current challenges. However, it is necessary to increase financial assistance to agricultural producers. The basic institution for financing agricultural activities in Poland is the Agency for the Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture, established as early as 1994 to support the development of agriculture and rural areas. Poland’s membership in the EU has significantly expanded the tasks of the ARMA. The ARMA uses new technologies, such as implementing the Area Monitoring System defined in Article 66(1) of Regulation (EU) 2021/2116 of the European Parliament and the Council.

AIM
To estimate the budget impact of adding a toripalimab regimen as a treatment option to the existing pembrolizumab regimen, both including gemcitabine and cisplatin, in untreated recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (R/M NPC) using the published wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) and average sales price (ASP).


METHODS
Budget impact analysis comparing a treatment mix "without" versus "with" the toripalimab regimen in the US eligible annual incident R/M NPC population, a 3-year time horizon, toripalimab/pembrolizumab market splits of 60/40 (Y1) and 80/20 (Y2/3), and medication adjustments for discontinuation or progression. Cost inputs included drugs, administration, and adverse event (AE) management. The models were replicated for a hypothetical 1-million-member health plan in which costs per-member-per-month (PMPM) and per-member-per-year (PMPY) were estimated. One-way (OWSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) as well as scenario analyses were performed.


RESULTS
In the "without" scenario, the 3-year WAC-based costs for the pembrolizumab regimen total $1,449,695,333 ($1,305,632,448 for treatment and $144,062,885 for managing AEs). In the "with" scenario, total 3-year costs for pembrolizumab decline to $380,012,135 with toripalimab adding $885,505,900 ($779,206,567 for treatment and $106,299,333 for AE management). Annual net savings range from $46,526,152 in 2024 to $71,194,214 in 2026, for 3-year savings of $184,177,298. Associated net savings in a 1-million-member health plan are $543,068 over 3 years with savings of $0.045 PMPM and $0.543 PMPY. The ASP-based model shows similar patterns with 3-year net savings of $174,235,983 in the US incident population and savings of $0.043 PMPM and $0.514 PMPY in a 1-million-member health plan. The PSA support base case findings; OWSA and scenario analyses reveal how parameter variability impacts results.


CONCLUSION
Savings between $174 million and $184 million can be achieved from treating 60% of R/M NPC patients in year 1 and 80% in years 2 and 3 with the toripalimab regimen over a similar pembrolizumab regimen.

AIM
To estimate the budget impact of adding a toripalimab regimen to the existing treatment mix of pembrolizumab, both with pemetrexed and carboplatin, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC within two price inputs (wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) and average sales price (ASP)).


METHODS
Budget impact analysis comparing a treatment mix "without" versus "with" the toripalimab regimen in the annual US nonsquamous NSCLC population treated with a PD-1 inhibitor, a 3-year time horizon, toripalimab market share of 1% in 2024, increasing to 4% (2025) and 5% (2026), and medication use adjustments for discontinuation or progression to estimate fully-treated-patient-equivalents. Cost inputs included drugs, administration, and grade 3/4 adverse event (AE) management. The models were replicated in a 1-million-member plan to estimate costs per-member-per-month (PMPM) and per-member-per-year (PMPY). One-way (OWSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) as well as two scenario analyses were performed.


RESULTS
In the "without" scenario, the 3-year WAC costs for the pembrolizumab regimen total $40,750,234,637 ($39,024,548,745 for treatment and $1,725,685,894 for managing AEs). In the "with" scenario, these costs decline to $39,341,379,081. Corresponding "with" costs for toripalimab are $1,186,027,704 (treatment) and $99,454,471 (AE management) for a total of $1,285,482,175. This yields annual net savings of between $10,779,362 (at 1% market share) in 2024 and $64,858,298 (5% market share) in 2026, for 3-year savings of $123,373,381. The associated savings in a 1-million-member plan are $0.030 PMPM and $0.363 PMPY. The ASP model shows similar patterns. Savings were demonstrated in 68% of PSA simulations; OWSAs and scenario analyses reveal how parameter variability impacts results.


CONCLUSION
Significant savings are likely achievable from treating between 1% (year 1) to 5% (year 3) of nonsquamous NSCLC patients with the toripalimab regimen. Projected 3-year savings range from $122 million (ASP) to $123 million (WAC); corresponding to savings of $0.030 PMPM and $0.363 PMPY.

Abstract Objectives To assess the public health and economic impact of vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, KP.2, in 2024/2025 in the United States. Methods A combined cohort Markov-decision tree model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of vaccination versus no vaccination in adults aged ≥18 years. The adult population was further stratified into 18-64 years and ≥65 years age groups. Public health surveillance data informed the annual proportion of individuals infected with and vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of those infected who were hospitalized, stratified by age. Other age-stratified clinical, cost, and vaccine effectiveness parameters were informed by literature. The budget impact analysis was based on a hypothetical 1-million-member plan and used a payer perspective. Parameter uncertainty was tested in sensitivity analyses. Results Without vaccination, the model projected 21.4 million new symptomatic cases, 15,793 deaths, 629,098 hospitalizations, $115.5 billion in total costs, and 1 million QALYs lost among adults aged ≥18 years, with the greatest health burden observed among older adults aged ≥65 years (72% of hospitalizations and 86% of deaths) and the greatest economic burden in adults aged 18–64 years (62% of total costs). Vaccination was projected to prevent 915,501 cases, 1,057 deaths, and 37,489 hospitalizations, resulting in cost savings of $513 million, 9,173 LYs gained, 56,482 QALYs gained, and a dominant ICER. In the budget impact analysis, vaccination was estimated to result in total incremental cost savings for the population aged ≥65 years and a modest budget increase for the population aged 18–64 years. Conclusions Vaccination with the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, KP.2, is a cost-effective measure from the societal perspective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 that could reduce the health and economic burden of COVID-19.

ABSTRACT 1. In recent years, public concern regarding animal welfare has increased while, at the same time, cage systems for animal production have been greatly criticised by EU citizens. In addition, large food retailers promote food products that are made with eggs produced in cage-free systems. 2. The objective of this study was to evaluate the economic viability of the transition of laying hens’ to production systems; from conventional to alternative systems with improved welfare. Three independent scenarios were assumed as follows: transition from enriched colony cages to barn (S1), transition from barn to free-range (S2), and transition from free-range to organic (S3). Economic assessments of each transition was applied to a model farm in Greece with 12 000 hens, through partial budget analysis and net benefits and costs were estimated. 3. The results showed a positive economic impact in all transitions to a production system of improved animal welfare (€12,044 in S1, €18,957 in S2 and €7,977 in S3) which indicated that they are economically sustainable. In all scenarios, unit cost increased by 19% in S1, 12% in S2, and 85% in S3. 4. In conclusion, transitioning towards improved animal welfare production systems in laying hen farms could be an economically viable option for egg producers in compliance with societal demands and market trends.

Date published: 2024

Abstract Despite remarkable clinical advances in highly effective anti-obesity medications, their high price and potential budget impact pose a major challenge in balancing equitable access and affordability. While most attention has been focused on the amount of weight loss achieved, less consideration has been paid to interventions to sustain weight loss after an individual stops losing weight. Using a policy simulation model, we quantified the impact of a weight-maintenance program following the weight-loss plateau from the initial full-dose glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists or incretin mimetic use. We measured long-term health care savings and the loss of some health benefits (eg, maintenance of weight loss, improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, and reductions in diabetes and cardiovascular events). Our model suggested that, compared with continuous long-term full-dose GLP-1 receptor agonists or incretin mimetic drugs, the alternative weight-maintenance program would generate slightly fewer clinical benefits while generating substantial savings in lifetime health care spending. Using less expensive and potentially less effective alternative weight-maintenance programs may provide additional headroom to expand access to anti-obesity medications during the active weight-loss phase without increasing total health care spending.

Background: Most employees will experience serious illness, caregiving, dying and loss (End-of-Life (EoL) experiences) at multiple points throughout their working lives. These experiences impact affected employees but also their colleagues in terms of health and wellbeing, and the workplace as a whole in terms of workplace safety, productivity and labour relations. The impact of EoL experiences on employees means that workplaces are called to play a more active role in providing support for EoL experiences. Aim: To describe how the EU-CoWork (2024–2028) project addresses its main aims to (1) create Compassionate Workplace cultures, practices and policies and improve health and wellbeing for employees dealing with EoL experiences in different national work contexts in Europe; (2) describe and evaluate the process of co-creation and implementation of Compassionate Workplace Programs (CWPs) and how these influence the programs’ outcomes. Design: EU-CoWork employs a facilitated and co-creative Developmental Evaluation approach to the development of 12 tailored CWPs across four European countries (Belgium, Austria, Sweden and Greece). Methods: To evaluate the outcomes and processes leading to these outcomes, a mixed-methods Realist Evaluation methodology is applied, formulating and testing Context-Mechanism-Outcomes configurations and combining longitudinal quantitative and qualitative data collections. Results: EU-CoWork will generate evidence to support an expanded model of occupational health and safety risk factors sensitive to the specific challenges related to employees’ EoL experiences. In doing so, several challenges will have to be navigated: involving employees with EoL experiences while avoiding overburdening them, avoiding tokenistic engagement, managing power differentials, balancing the need for scientific rigour with the flexibility required in co-creation, reconciling different epistemologies and disciplinary traditions and organisational resistance to change. Conclusion: There are potential long-lasting broader societal impacts through the stimulation of open discourse on EoL topics, the reconciliation of work and care, and changes in gendered work and care patterns.
