Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health challenge, projected to cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050.1 In response, the UK Government developed a five-year national action plan, 'Confronting Antimicrobial Resistance 2024 to 2029,' aimed at optimising antimicrobial use and implementing antimicrobial stewardship.2 The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the healthcare system, jeopardising public health and causing millions of deaths worldwide. The pandemic has exacerbated AMR due to increased antimicrobial therapy and misuse.3
 
 
 
 This study explores healthcare workers’ (HCWs) views towards antibiotic prescribing, AMS and AMR during the COVID-19 pandemic in a UK secondary care setting.
 
 
 
 This cross-sectional study employed an online questionnaire survey conducted at an NHS Foundation Trust in the East of England, targeting doctors, nurses, and pharmacists. The total eligible participants comprised 5,636 doctors, 2,140 nurses, and 206 pharmacists. Data collection was carried out using Qualtrics XM from 12 June to 13 September 2023. Inclusion criteria required healthcare workers (HCWs) to be adults aged 25 or older, registered with relevant professional bodies, and employed during the pandemic. Data analysis involved both descriptive statistics and qualitative methods to interpret participants’ open-ended responses to the question, “What lessons have been learnt during the COVID-19 pandemic?” This study was registered under ISRCTN number 14825813 and received ethical approval from the University of Hertfordshire Ethics and Health Research Authority (HRA) (REC reference number 22/EM/0161). The Citizens Senate reviewed the study protocol to ensure public and patient involvement.
 
 
 
 A total of 23 HCWs completed the survey, including 12 pharmacists, nine doctors, and two nurses. The survey included an open-text section where respondents shared lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among pharmacists, 75% (9 out of 12) identified inappropriate antibiotic use without clinical justification as a significant issue, and 67% (8 out of 12) reported an increase in healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs). Additionally, 83% (10 out of 12) noted the positive impact of technology platforms and antibiotic reviews on implementing effective and sustainable AMS. Among doctors, 89% (8 out of 9) emphasised the need for reliable information dissemination, observing that social media often overshadowed evidence-based guidelines. Additionally, 78% (7 out of 9) stressed the importance of staying informed about resistance patterns and antibiotic prescribing trends. All nurses highlighted the significance of AMR awareness and reported that mental fatigue affected decision-making during the pandemic.
 
 
 
 This study highlights the essential role of technology platforms in enhancing antimicrobial stewardship practices and the necessity of disseminating reliable information to counter misinformation. The pandemic highlighted the need for clear guidelines and robust communication strategies to support clinical practices. However, this study has limitations, including a small sample size of 23 participants, which may affect the generalisability of the findings. Future research should include larger, more diverse samples to validate these findings and assess specific AMS interventions. The study also revealed the importance of resilient AMS implementation to optimise antibiotic use and improve patient outcomes. Achieving this requires ongoing AMS education, interdisciplinary collaboration, and adaptive strategies to effectively mitigate antimicrobial resistance.

Introduction: Article 25 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), states that persons with disabilities have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health. Psychotropic medications are sometimes used when a person with intellectual disabilities (ID) presents with a challenging behaviour. Such behaviour could lead to the child being expelled from school or being sent away from family to reside in a residential setting. The first line of interventions should be psychological and a behavioural support plan should be commenced; in addition, a parent training programme should be considered to try to tackle the behaviour according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Guidelines.

Stomp-Stamp Guidelines were launched in December 2018 by NHS England and The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. The British Association of Childhood Disability and the Council for Disabled Children pledged to ensure that children and young people with intellectual disability, autism or both, have access to appropriate medication [in line with NICE guidance] and are not prescribed inappropriate medication.

Purpose: The aim of this study is to identify the compliance of the Child and Adolescent Intellectual Disability Psychiatric Service (CAID) in South Wales with the STOMP-STAMP guidelines in the monitoring of children and adolescents with Intellectual Disability who are prescribed psychotropic medications.

Methodology: A retrospective study of clinical notes of children and adolescents with moderate to severe intellectual disability (that is an IQ of less than 50), who are currently under CAID’s tertiary mental health service.

Results: The notes of 59 children and adolescents were studied (78% males and 22% females, age range 8-17 years with mean age of 13.49 years and STD 2.254). Autism Spectrum disorder was the most common comorbid diagnosis, followed by anxiety disorders. A total of 3.3% of the children had an additional diagnosis of Down’s Syndrome. Epilepsy was increasingly associated with polypharmacy, poor response to medications and severe challenging behaviour. Consents to medications were well documented and obtained from those with parental responsibilities. More than half of the participants were on monotherapy. The antipsychotics were the most common medication prescribed, followed by antidepressants. Diagnoses of the comorbid conditions were well documented in each file. Insomnia was the most common symptom with the majority being on sleeping medicines. Obesity was the commonest physical health problem in the sample followed by constipation; both are known side effects of antipsychotic medication. Most of the children could not have the appropriate investigations recommended by NICE guidelines before initiating the medicine, such as blood work and an ECG.

Study Limitations: This study has some limitations. The sample size is relatively small. The catchment area of the service is relatively a deprived one so the findings could not be generalised. The study excluded children and adolescents with mild intellectual disability.

Conclusions and Recommendations: Medication, including polypharmacy, is still the main method of controlling severe challenging behaviour in the absence of evidence-based psychological therapy such as Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA). Judicious use of antipsychotics is required in the ID population given the increased risk of the side effects to the child and young person’s short-term and long-term physical health. The importance of multi-agencies working to minimise use of antipsychotics should be stressed.

Originality Value and Practical Implications: Although this study was conducted at a national level, linking this work to UNCRPD provides for a macro level accountability framework. The practical implications are that by engaging in a systematic time serious analysis of practice, this will ensure continual service improvement, ultimately safeguarding the rights of such vulnerable children and adolescents.

3. [An evaluation of the role of social identity processes for enhancing health outcomes within UK‐based social prescribing initiatives designed to increase social connection and reduce loneliness: A systematic review](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aea331bca71fda429c43fc0fff80dc18f82846e5)

The UK's National Health Service has introduced Social Prescribing initiatives to tackle loneliness and ill‐health, yet it lacks a theoretical foundation and evidence base for Social Prescribing's effectiveness. Recent research applies the Social Identity Approach to Health (SIAH) to explain Social Prescribing's health benefits, emphasising how social connection unlocks health‐enhancing psychological mechanisms. This systematic review therefore aims to assess UK‐based Social Prescribing programmes designed to boost social connection and alleviate loneliness, examining programme efficacy and the role of SIAH processes in health outcomes. Following PRISMA guidelines, a narrative synthesis of articles published from May 5, 2006 (when social prescribing was first introduced in the NHS), to April 8, 2024, was conducted, and their quality assessed using CONSORT‐SPI (2018). Of these programmes, 10 employed a mixed‐methods design, 8 qualitative and 1 quantitative service evaluation, totalling 3,298 participants. Results indicate that Social Prescribing's psychological value lies in quality rather than quantity of social connections, with meaningful connections fostering shared identity, perceived support and self‐efficacy, the latter of which sustains social engagement post‐programme. The SIAH was a useful tool for mapping mixed‐methods findings onto a common theoretical framework to highlight these key proponents. Overall, this review underscores the importance of SIAH‐informed Social Prescribing interventions in enhancing social connectedness, reducing loneliness, and promoting overall health.

Aims Sleep disorders, such as insomnia, are common in the general population and in patients with psychiatric conditions including the behavioural addiction Gambling Disorder (GD). The NHS Southern Gambling Service (SGS) is a tertiary centre providing evidence-based assessment and treatment for people affected by GD across the South-East of England. We aimed to assess the prevalence of sleep problems in help-seeking adults with gambling difficulties, including the association with gambling severity and other measures of psychopathology, and determine if 1) sleep is appropriately assessed and 2) whether sleep disorders are appropriately diagnosed and managed, in line with NICE guidelines, in this particular cohort. Methods All patients referred from September 2022–October 2023 who completed an initial clinician assessment were included. Gathered data included age, gender, pre-existing physical health conditions, and scores from the following questionnaires: Gambling Symptoms Assessment Scale (GSAS), Pathological Gambling Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (PG-YBOCS), Brief Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (B-PSQI), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7). Data analysis was performed under ethical approval (23/HRA/0279). Relationships between gambling severity and sleep quality, and depressive/anxiety symptoms were explored (using Pearson correlation coefficient). In patients with a B-PSQI score > 5 (suggestive of underlying sleep disorder), we determined whether sleep problems were appropriately assessed and managed. Results 83 patients completed an initial clinician assessment (81% male, average age 38 years). Baseline B-PSQI scores were weekly positively correlated with gambling severity on the GSAS (r = 0.18) and the PG-YBOCS (r = 0.10) and anxiety symptoms severity on the GAD-7 (r = 0.26). Baseline B-PSQI scores were moderately positively correlated with depressive symptom severity on the PHQ-9 (r = 0.39) and higher B-PSQI scores were noted in patients reporting suicidality. 54/83 (65%) patients had a baseline B-PSQI score > 5, of these, seven (13%) had a clearly documented management plan for insomnia in line with NICE guidelines. Conclusion Most patients referred to SGS had baseline B-PSQI scores suggestive of current sleep problems. B-PSQI scores were positively correlated with gambling severity and severity of anxiety and depression. Findings highlight that sleep problems are common in people presenting to the NHS gambling service, but also that there is scope to improve and extend signposting for affected individuals to receive sleep-specific support. The audit findings have been presented to the SGS team; resources for the assessment and management of sleep problems have been shared and a re-audit is planned for Summer 2024.

Introduction
 Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, lethal hyperinflammatory syndrome. Trigger factors include genetic, auto-immunity, viral infections and blood cancers, commonly lymphoma. The IL1-antagonist anakinra is approved by NHS-England for HLH despite a paucity of data on response rates and survival, both overall and for individual triggers. We report outcomes for HLH treated with anakinra and steroids from the East Midlands in England (population ~4-5 million) which use unified clinical guidelines.
 Methods
 Cases of HLH treated with anakinra were identified using mandatory national drug commissioning forms. HLH diagnoses were confirmed using the H-score. Patient demographics, trigger factors, response to and duration of use of anakinra, and the use of later therapies for triggers were planned to be presented descriptively. Survival was analysed using Kaplan-Meier methods with overall survival (OS) considered as the start date of anakinra to date of death or last follow up with data follow up to 15th July 2024
 Results
 Between 1st March 2022 and 1st June 2024, 25 cases were identified. Two patients had 2 separate HLH episodes which were considered separately. Median age was 65 (25-79) years, and 11 (44%) were male and 14 (56%) female. The median H-Score prior to anakinra was 210 (178-363) and median ferritin 21,392ug/l (1,591-210,815). 14/23 (61%) had hemophagocytosis on bone marrow biopsy.
 16 (64%) cases had prior blood cancer or were diagnosed at HLH presentation, including 9 (36%) lymphomas, 3 of which were EBV positive. Four (16%) had auto-immune disease, including three (12%) adult-onset Still's disease and one (4%) systemic lupus erythematosus. Three cases (12%) had EBV-related HLH with no proven lymphoma and 2 (8%) had no trigger identified. 13 (52%) had a history of immunosuppression, HIV (n=1), recent chemotherapy (n=7) and steroids (n=5).
 The median time from hospital admission to anakinra was 10 days (1-41), and from HLH diagnosis to anakinra 1 day (0-13). All patients began anakinra at 2mg/kg/day s/c and 8 (32%) had dose escalations up to 8mg/kg/day. The median number of days of anakinra received was 10 (1-44). All 25 cases received concurrent corticosteroids and two (8%) received empirical etoposide and 13 (52%) later received treatment for specific triggers, 7 (28%) targeted chemotherapy (6/9 with lymphoma), 5 (20%) immunosuppression and 1(4%) anti-viral therapy. Thirteen (52%) patients were considered to have responded to empirical/directed treatment. 12/23 (52%) unique patients died, 7 (28%) directly due to HLH, with the majority of deaths occurring within one week of HLH diagnosis.
 With a median follow up of 13 months, median OS for the whole cohort was 103 days with no deaths after this time; Patients with blood cancer had a median OS of 24 days, however, median OS for those with lymphoma was not reached (NR), in contrast with other blood cancers which was only 12 days. Only one lymphoma patient who received chemotherapy died. Patients without blood cancer had even better outcomes with median OS NR and only two deaths, both within three days of HLH diagnosis. Of these, one had EBV viraemia and one no trigger identified, so underlying blood cancer cannot be excluded. All patients with auto-immune triggers remain alive.
 Conclusion
 Preliminary data suggests anakinra results in excellent outcomes for HLH due to autoimmune disease and, likely by improving curative chemotherapy delivery, impressive outcomes for lymphoma associated. Outcomes for other HLH due to blood cancers appear extremely poor, in part related to underlying disease aggressiveness. Regional clinical guidelines across large geographical areas help address variation in physician awareness, diagnosis and management of HLH.

Improving surveillance of antibiotic prescribing and reducing health inequalities in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are priorities in the new 5 year AMR national action plan (2024-2029)1. People in contact with the justice system are one of the inclusion groups in the CORE20plus5, a national NHE England approach to support reduction of health inequalities.2
 
 
 
 This project aimed to collate and analyse all antibiotic prescribing data from English prisons in order to identify opportunities for quality improvement.
 
 
 
 This project analysed antibiotic prescribing data from September 2022 to current date for the first time in HJS from the IT system used in all prisons in England. No ethical approval is required as surveillance is of anonymised data only.
 Data was broken down by age band (18 and under, 19-49, 50 and over), category of prison, region, ICB, individual prison and antibiotic type.
 The dashboard allows benchmarking across sites and comparison with primary care, as prisoners in HJS are considered to have similar infections to primary care patients.
 
 
 
 The majority of prescribing is in male prisoners, reflecting the male/female population split. The most frequently prescribed antibiotics are those used for: skin and soft tissue (including acne), respiratory tract, dental and urinary tract infections. A number of focus areas for quality improvement have been identified, including:
 
 
 
 (Cephalosporins, Co-amoxiclav and Quinolones), target of <10% total antibiotic prescribing in primary care, in HJS, currently 11%. Appropriate quinolone prescribing is a target in all settings due to recent MHRA alert3.
 Acne prescribing represents a significant proportion of antibiotic prescribing in HJS. Lymecycline 12%, whereas in primary care <3%.
 Duration of Antibiotic Courses: In primary care there is a medicines optimisation opportunity ambition to achieve 75% prescribing amoxicillin 500mg as 5 day duration. In HJS only 27% is for 5 days. When prescribing 100mg doxycycline for respiratory infections, NICE guidance recommends a 5 day course, but in HJS only 3% is prescribed as a 5 day course. For UTI in female prisons, nitrofurantoin 100mg MR is most commonly prescribed, NICE guidance for UTI in women is for 3 days; 47% in HJS are for 3 days, but 35% are 7 day courses.
 
 
 
 This dashboard provides insight into antibiotic prescribing data allowing opportunities for quality improvement opportunities to be identified and antimicrobial stewardship interventions to be evaluated.
 This work will progress to tackle the focus areas identified. Next steps are to work with antibiotic champions from HJS to co-produce intervention plans, share patient safety messages, trial available resources, rollout interventions and monitor impact via the dashboard.
 
 
 
 Indications are not available from the data but extrapolated from the antibiotic prescribed.
 The dashboard is currently an excel spreadsheet in NHSE. It will be moved to a platform that enables access by individual prisons.

Voxelotor is a novel treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD) which acts to reduce haemoglobin polymerisation by improving the oxygen affinity of sickle haemoglobin. The phase 3 HOPE randomised controlled trial demonstrated a statistically significant increase in haemoglobin concentration without a statistically significant reduction in vaso-oclusive pain events compared to placebo (excluding subgroup analysis) in individuals with SCD treated with voxelotor.
 In May 2024, the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales announced that voxelotor will be reimbursed for the treatment of haemolytic anaemia caused by SCD in people 12 years and over, in those who are ineligible for, or intolerant of hydroxycarbamide, or for whom hydroxycarbamide alone is insufficiently effective. A national survey of specialist and non-specialist haematologists involved in the treatment of patients with SCD in England and Wales was conducted to understand their awareness and knowledge of this novel disease modifying agent.
 There were 67 respondents, the majority of which were resident haematology doctors (35, 52%) and attending haematology doctors (29, 43%), of which 22 (33%) were specialists in sickle cell disease. Forty-four (66%) respondents practice at a specialist haemoglobinopathy treatment centre - in the UK these are classified as haemoglobinopathy coordinating centres (HCC; 27, 40%) and specialist haemoglobinopathy teams (SHT; 17, 26%); the remainder cared for SCD patients at non-specialist centres. Nineteen (28%) reported being directly involved in the care of >100 SCD per year, 12 (18%) 50-100, 17 (26%) 10-50, 19 (28%) <10.
 The majority (58, 87%) of respondents were aware of the existence of voxelotor as a treatment for SCD; 44 (66%) were aware of the recent decision by the NHS to reimburse this medication. Twenty-nine (43%) correctly identified the mechanism of action of voxelotor; 19 (28%) did not correctly identify the mechanism of action; 19 (28%) were not sure.
 Thirty-eight (57%) of respondents correctly identified the efficacy results of the HOPE 3 study; 11 (16%) did not identify the correct result; 18 (27%) stated they were not sure. Seventeen (25%) correctly identified the safety (adverse events) results of the HOPE 3 study; the majority (33; 50%) were not sure; the remainder (17, 25%) did not identify the correct result.
 Twenty-six (39%) of respondents correctly stated that voxelotor is reimbursed for the treatment of adults and children >12 years with SCD in the UK; 26 (39%) reported being unsure regarding the age of patients for which voxelotor is reimbursed; 14 (22%) selected an incorrect response. Forty-seven (70%) of respondents correctly understood that voxelotor can be administered alongside hydroxycarbamide; 19 (28%) were not sure, 1 (2%) incorrectly stated that the medications could not be given concurrently.
 Thirty-one (46%) of respondents stated they have previously cared for SCD patients who take voxelotor. It should be noted that this medication was previously available via an Early Access to Medicines Scheme in England on an individual patient basis.
 Thirty-two (48%) clinicians stated that the recent NICE decision to reimburse voxelotor will influence their decision to prescribe the medication for their patients. If they wanted to prescribe voxelotor for a patient with SCD, most (41; 61%) said they would obtain this medication from their patient's HCC or SHT.
 This data provides valuable insights regarding the knowledge gaps around voxelotor among physicians treating patients with SCD. There is a high degree of unmet need in this patient group, with limited treatment options available. Our data suggests inadequate physician knowledge pertaining to the potential benefits and side effects of voxelotor, which may adversely affect appropriate patient selection and communication to patients considering treatment. In addition, physician attitudes towards access to this medication suggests a centralised model of access to this medication will predominate, which may affect timely access to treatment for those patients living in areas with low rates of SCD. This data will be used to develop efforts at a national level to improve physician knowledge regarding voxelotor and help achieve equitable access to treatment for all SCD patients regardless of geographical location.

Abstract T.A. Alomar: None. A. Joshi: None. E. Ponce: None. D.F. Kaune: None. E. Fraser: None. S. Alomar: None. M. Hazin: None. Introduction: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and diabetes (DM) are two closely linked conditions that have been shown to be successfully treated with both glitazones (TZDs) and GLP-1 agonists. However, GLP-1 agonists are often prohibitively expensive, especially for many underserved and uninsured patients. Both of these drugs are the preferred first-line treatment for NASH concurrent with DM according to the 2023 American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines. In this study, we examined the prescribing patterns of TZDs and GLP-1 agonists and surveyed providers to understand their hesitancy in prescribing TZDs. Methods: Medical records at a low income/uninsured clinic were analyzed. Patient records with a diagnosis of DM, NASH, and DM concurrent with NASH were extracted using ICD-10 codes, along with prescribed medications. Furthermore, a survey of primary care, GI/hepatology, and endocrinology providers associated with the free clinic was conducted. The survey included questions on prescribing patterns, and provider attitudes regarding the treatment of DM and NASH. Results: 1019 patient records were extracted. 57 patients had a diagnosis of both DM and NASH. Only 2/57 patients had been prescribed pioglitazone and 4/57 patients had been prescribed GLP-1 agonists. Survey results yielded 23 responses. Metformin (90%) and insulin (45%) were the most frequent medications used to treat DM, whereas lifestyle changes (70%) and GLP-1 agonists (60%) were the most popular treatments for NASH. For DM concurrent with NASH, the most popular treatments were metformin (89%) and GLP-1 agonists (74%). Only 11% of providers reported using pioglitazone to treat DM concurrent with NASH. 70% of providers stated they were not aware of the most recent ADA recommendations. 60% of physicians were most concerned about side effects of pioglitazone, specifically edema and heart failure. Discussion: Our study found that only a small handful (3%) of our population of uninsured patients with NASH concurrent with DM were prescribed TZDs. Even though providers indicated they would rather use GLP-1 agonists, patients were not prescribed these either, likely due to their prohibitive costs. Doctors were unaware of the ADA guidelines and overly concerned with edema as a side effect. Meta-analyses indicate that TZDs are associated with an increased risk of edema and heart failure, but they reduce the risk of heart attack and have no effect on all cause mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease. Given that TZDs do not increase mortality, reverse hepatic fibrosis, and are cheaper than GLP-1 agonists, increased awareness for their use in the treatment of concurrent DM and NASH is needed.

Originally a paper-based resource, the UKCPA Handbook of Perioperative Medicines1 moved online in 2019 and the website was updated in March 2024, with improved functionality. The resource aims to standardise management of medication during the perioperative period by providing evidence-based advice and guidance for healthcare professionals, removing the need for local Trust guidelines.
 
 
 
 To evaluate current use of, and opinions of users of, the UKCPA Handbook of Perioperative Medicines.
 
 
 
 Usage data, including engagement rate and time and frequently accessed monographs, was obtained for 4th-March-2024 to 29th-May-2024 from Google Analytics and the website dashboard. Further usage information and user opinion was collected using a 9-question survey hosted on Survey Monkey and disseminated via UKCPA’s ‘X’ account and Surgery and Theatres Committee, plus NHS England non-medical pre-operative association network. Ethical approval was not required as this was a service evaluation.2
 
 
 
 Analytics
 Most (79%, 23158) users are from the United Kingdom where the engagement rate is 64%. Outside the UK most users are from Australia (1858), Ireland (785) and the United States (575). The average engagement time is 3-minutes and 42-seconds. Frequently accessed monographs include antiplatelets (aspirin, clopidogrel), direct oral anticoagulants (apixaban, edoxaban) and diabetic medication (sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, insulin).
 Survey
 Of the 237 responses received, individual question completion rates varied. 72% (170) of respondents were aware of the Handbook of which 89% (151) use it, with 22% (34) having it as their sole resource. Respondents were predominantly from NHS secondary care sector and comprised of pharmacists (24%, 58), pre-assessment nurses (21%, 49) and anaesthetists (19%, 44). Most (84%, 133) users access it via desktop. 85% (132) of respondents either “strongly agreed” or “agreed” that it has a professional appearance, 82% (128) that it has good search functionality and 80% (126) that they could find the required information.
 
 
 
 The Handbook is mostly accessed within the United Kingdom, where it has a good engagement rate.3 However, there is usage on a global scale from countries including Australia, Ireland, USA, NZ, Canada, and Germany. Monographs for medicines considered ‘high-risk’ or where there is potential controversy about their perioperative management are the most accessed.
 There is good awareness of the Handbook from respondents, with the majority of those familiar with it using it in their area of work. It is expected that those who are aware of the Handbook would be more likely to respond to the survey. The Handbook is mainly used within the NHS secondary care setting, where most surgical procedures take place. However, it is likely that due to how the survey was disseminated, this influenced the healthcare professional groups that responded.
 In general, the Handbook is deemed to have a professional appearance, good search functionality and includes information that healthcare professionals require.
 The aim of the Handbook is to provide a standardised, evidence-based resource for healthcare professionals for perioperative medicines management. The survey results indicate that there is still variation in practice with centres choosing to use it in conjunction with other guidelines as opposed to their sole resource.
