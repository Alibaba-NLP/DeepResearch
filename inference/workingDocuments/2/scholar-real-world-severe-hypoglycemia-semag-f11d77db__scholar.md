Objective: Severe hypoglycemia (SH) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) remain significant risks with intensive insulin therapy. While these adverse event (AE) rates are generally very low in advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) clinical studies, prospectively collected real-world AE rates are lacking. Research Design and Methods: The Control-IQ Observational (CLIO) study was a single-arm, prospective, longitudinal, postmarket surveillance study of individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) age 6 years and older who began the use of t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control-IQ technology in the real-world outpatient setting. AEs were reported monthly over 12 months and were compared to historical data from the T1D Exchange. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed quarterly. All study visits were virtual. Results: Three thousand one hundred fifty-seven participants enrolled from August 2020 through March 2022. Two thousand nine hundred ninety-eight participants completed through 12 months. SH rates were significantly lower than historic rates for children (9.31 vs. 19.31 events/100 patient years, d = 0.29, P < 0.01) and adults (9.77 vs. 29.49 events/100 patient years, d = 0.53, P < 0.01). DKA rates were also significantly lower in both groups. Lower observed rates of AEs occurred independent of baseline hemoglobin A1c or prior insulin delivery method. Time in range 70–180 mg/dL was 70.1% (61.0–78.8) for adults, 61.2% (52.4–70.5) for age 6–13, 60.9% (50.1–71.8) for age 14–17, and 67.3% (57.4–76.9) overall. Reduction in diabetes burden was consistently reported. Conclusions: SH and DKA rates were lower for users of t:slim X2 with Control-IQ technology compared to historical data for both adults and children. Real-world use of this AHCL system proved safe and effective in this virtual study design. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04503174)

OBJECTIVE To assess the burden of disease for adults with type 1 diabetes in a U.S. electronic health record database by evaluating acute and microvascular complications stratified by age and glycemic control. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This is a retrospective observational study of adults with type 1 diabetes (1 July 2014–30 June 2016) classified using a validated algorithm, with disease duration ≥24 months and, during a 12-month baseline period, not pregnant and having one or more insulin prescriptions and one or more HbA1c measurements. Demographic characteristics, acute complications (severe hypoglycemia [SH], diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]), and microvascular complications (neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy) were stratified by age (18–25, 26–49, 50–64, ≥65 years) and glycemic control (HbA1c <7%, 7% to <9%, ≥9%). RESULTS Of 31,430 patients, ∼20% had HbA1c <7%. Older patients had lower HbA1c values than younger patients (P < 0.001). Patients with poor glycemic control had the highest annual incidence of SH (4.2%, 4.0%, and 8.3%) and DKA (1.3%, 2.8%, and 15.8%) for HbA1c <7%, 7% to <9%, and ≥9% cohorts, respectively (both P < 0.001), and a higher prevalence of neuropathy and nephropathy (both P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS For adults with type 1 diabetes, glycemic control appears worse than previously estimated. Rates of all complications increased with increasing HbA1c. Compared with HbA1c <7%, HbA1c ≥9% was associated with twofold and 12-fold higher incidences of SH and DKA, respectively. Younger adults had more pronounced higher risks of SH and DKA associated with poor glycemic control than older adults.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Clinical trial research on the safety and efficacy of coronary orbital atherectomy (OA) in diabetics compared to non-diabetics is limited. This single-center study aimed to perform a diabetic comparative analysis using real-world data.


METHODS
A retrospective analysis was conducted on consecutive patients undergoing coronary OA treatment for severely calcified lesions at Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach, Florida (MSMCMB), from January 2014 to September 2020. Severe angiographic complications, bleeding complications, in-hospital heart failure and cardiogenic shock were reviewed. Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), including cardiac death, MI, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) were assessed in-hospital and at 1- and 2-year follow-up.


RESULTS
A total of 609 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with OA were identified. Among them, 43% were diabetic with a median age of 75 for both cohorts. In the diabetic cohort, there was a higher prevalence of Hispanics (66% vs. 51%; p < 0.001), dyslipidemia (81% vs. 72%; p = 0.005), and hypertension (94% vs. 89%; p = 0.033). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of severe angiographic complications, bleeding complications, in-hospital MACCE or MACCE at 1- and 2-year follow-ups.


CONCLUSIONS
This real-world comparative analysis suggests that coronary OA is a safe and effective plaque modification technique in diabetic patients with severely calcified coronary artery disease, with outcomes comparable to those of non-diabetics.

Introduction The treatment landscape for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is complex and constantly evolving, and real-world evidence of prescribing patterns is limited. The objectives of this study were to characterize lines of therapy (LOTs), calculate the length of time spent on each LOT, and identify the reasons for the LOT end among patients who initiated oral semaglutide for T2DM. Methods This retrospective, claims-based study included commercial and Medicare Advantage adults with T2DM. Data from November 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020, were obtained from Optum Research Database. Patients with ≥ 1 claim for oral semaglutide and continuous health plan enrollment for ≥ 12 months prior to (baseline period) and ≥ 6 months following (follow-up period) the date of the first oral semaglutide claim were included. LOT 1 began on the date of the first oral semaglutide claim. The start date of any subsequent LOTs was the date of the first claim for an additional non-insulin anti-diabetic drug class or a reduction in drug class with use of commitment medications. The LOT ended at the first instance of medication class discontinuation, change in regimen or end of follow-up. Results Of the 1937 patients who initiated oral semaglutide, 950 (49.0%) remained on their initial regimen over the 6-month follow-up period, 844 (43.6%) had at least one subsequent LOT, and 89 (4.6%) had at least two subsequent LOTs. Among patients with more than one LOT, approximately 20%–25% used oral semaglutide as monotherapy or combination therapy during LOTs 2 and 3. Metformin was frequently used during treatment across all LOTs. Conclusion This study provides insight for physicians and payers into the real-world prescribing practices within the first 6 months following oral semaglutide initiation and fills the gap in understanding the frequency of regimen changes in the constantly evolving and complex environment of T2DM care.

Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health concern, with 50–70% of the burden attributed to non-diabetic aetiology. To expand CKD research, there is a need to identify novel surrogate endpoints preceding cardiorenal outcomes that are commonly used in CKD trials. This study explored and quantified associations between intercurrent events and clinical outcomes in patients with non-diabetic CKD to inform potential surrogate endpoints. Methods In this retrospective observational cohort study, adults with non-diabetic, moderate-to-severe CKD (stage 3/4) were identified in the US Optum Clinformatics® Data Mart healthcare claims database. Key outcomes were hospitalization for heart failure, kidney failure/need for dialysis, and worsening of CKD stage from baseline. Intercurrent events were defined as events observed in patient medical or pharmacy claims after the cohort inclusion date that either precluded a clinical outcome of interest or were associated with a modified risk of the respective outcome. Intercurrent events were selected a priori or by a data-driven exploratory approach. Associations between intercurrent events and clinical outcomes were explored and quantified using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results The study cohort included 504,924 patients. An outpatient heart failure diagnosis code was associated with an increased risk of consequent hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio [HR]: 12.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.67–13.17). CKD stage 4 diagnosis code was associated with an increased risk of kidney failure/need for dialysis (HR: 3.75, 95% CI: 3.69–3.81). Dispensation of potassium-removing resins and potassium-binding agents as an intercurrent event was associated with an increased risk of consequent worsening of CKD stage (HR: 4.83, 95% CI: 4.51–5.17). The estimated glomerular filtration rate decline in 295,174 patients with available laboratory data was associated with progressively increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure and kidney failure/need for dialysis. Conclusions Associations between intercurrent events and clinical outcomes in patients with non-diabetic CKD were investigated, quantified, and ranked using a large set of routinely collected data from a US claims database. Our approach may help identify novel surrogate endpoints that occur earlier in the disease course and could be leveraged as indicators of clinical outcomes in CKD research.

Background: Upper gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, such as gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia (FD), contribute significantly to morbidity, especially in populations at risk for type 2 diabetes. However, the prevalence and clinical manifestations of these disorders in India, and associated gastric dysrhythmias, are not well studied within this population. Methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional study analyzed 3689 patients who underwent electrogastrography with water load satiety test (EGGWLST) testing across multiple motility clinics in India. The prevalence of gastroparesis and FD-like symptoms, symptom severity, and their association with diabetes and other comorbidities were evaluated. Symptom severity was assessed using the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI). EGGWLST findings were documented, including the gastric myoelectric activity threshold (GMAT) scores. Results: The study population had a mean age of 43.18 years. GCSI scores indicated that patients had symptoms that were mild (55%), moderate (33%), and severe (8%). Compared with the non-diabetic population, diabetic subjects had significantly higher rates of early satiety (56% vs. 45%, p < 0.0001), bloating (73% vs. 67%, p = 0.005), and reflux (28% vs. 24%, p = 0.029). WLST data analysis revealed that significantly more diabetic subjects ingested <350 mL (16% vs. 12%, p = 0.000016). EGG analysis revealed gastric dysthymias in one-third (65%) of patients. Significantly more diabetic subjects (22% vs. 18% p = 0.015) had a GMAT score >0.59. Conclusions: Upper GI motility disorders are prevalent in India, particularly among diabetic patients. EGG is a valuable tool for characterizing these disorders, and may help in personalizing therapeutic approaches. Further research is required to optimize treatment strategies.

Real-world (RW) drug safety studies complement safety information from randomized clinical trials. This post hoc analysis of pooled data from nine global non-interventional studies (SURE program: 10 countries, ~30 weeks duration) investigated the safety and prescription patterns of once-weekly (OW) semaglutide in 3,505 adults with T2D in routine practice, overall and by patient subgroup and medical specialty stratification. All safety data reported by site physicians were collected and presented using descriptive statistics. Results: Tables 1 and 2. A two-fold increase in level-2 hypoglycemia was associated with insulin use and microvasculopathy. No new safety concerns were observed with OW semaglutide in this large, diverse, RW population with T2D; the safety profile was in line with that of phase 3 trials of semaglutide.
