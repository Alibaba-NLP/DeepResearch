The article provides an overview of information on cases of adverse reactions with the use of semaglutide, reports of which are included in the database of the World Health Organization’s international drug monitoring program as of February 26, 2024. The study carries out an analysis of the safety indicators of semaglutide, which is a drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the drug gained its popularity due to its ability to reduce appetite. Semaglutide has been registered in the Russian Federation since 2019, and there is not enough information about adverse reactions related to its use. Characterization of the structure of adverse reactions associated with the use of semaglutide includes data on various factors, such as gender, age of patients, the nature of their complaints, severity of outcomes, geographic distribution, and initiators of the reports. These data can serve as a theoretical basis for improving and customizing the pharmacovigilance and drug monitoring system in Russia and are of practical interest for doctors, researchers, and health care regulators.

Background: For the past five years, our annual reports have been tracking the clinical development of new drug-based therapies for the neurodegenerative condition of Parkinson’s disease (PD). These reviews have followed the progress both of “symptomatic treatments” (ST – improves/reduces symptoms of the condition) and “disease-modifying treatments” (DMT – attempts to delay/slow progression by addressing the underlying biology of PD). Efforts have also been made to further categorize these experimental treatments based on their mechanisms of action and class of drug. Methods: A dataset of clinical trials for drug therapies in PD using trial data downloaded from the ClinicalTrials.gov online registry was generated. A breakdown analysis of all the studies that were active as of January 31st, 2024, was conducted. This analysis involved categorizing the trials based on both the mechanism of action (MOA) and the drug target. Results: There were 136 active Phase 1–3 trials evaluating drug therapies for PD registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, as of January 31, 2024. Of these trials, 76 (56%) were classified as ST trials and 60 (44%) were designated DMT. More than half (58%) of the trials were in Phase 2 testing stage, followed by Phase 1 (30%) and Phase 3 (12%). 35 of the trials were registered since our last report, with the remaining 101 trials appearing in at least one earlier report. Conclusions: The drug development pipeline for PD remains in a robust state with a wide variety of approaches being developed and evaluated in Phase 1 and 2. Yet again, however, only a limited number of DMTs are transitioning to Phase 3. Plain Language Summary The development of new medical therapies, particularly for neurodegenerative conditions, is a long process that involves multiple phases of testing before a treatment is approved for use in a doctor’s clinic. The first phase assesses the short-term safety of a drug – most often in healthy volunteers but sometimes in people affected by the disease. The second phase explores the short-term safety and preliminary efficacy of the agent in people affected by the disease of interest, and the third phase investigates long-term safety and efficacy in a large group of people affected by the disease. For a disease like Parkinson’s disease, where the causes of the condition are not well understood, drugs targeting different biological pathways need to be tested to determine which ones may be useful in treating the symptoms, and which could be administered to slow down or stop the progression of the condition. Here, we provide an annual report on the current landscape of both these clinical testing efforts. In total, we reviewed 136 active studies evaluating therapies for Parkinson’s disease registered on a clinical trial database called ‘ClinicalTrials.gov’. Of these trials, approximately 55% were testing experimental symptomatic treatments, while the rest were focused on slowing down disease progression. More than half (58%) of the studies were in the second phase of clinical testing (short-term safety and preliminary efficacy), but only three studies were found to be testing treatments to stop the progression of Parkinson’s in the Phase 3 testing. We concluded that the drug development pipeline for Parkinson’s is robust, but more progress needs to be made with late-stage testing of treatments to slow the disease.

ABSTRACT Pharmacological treatment of obesity is passing through many changes in the last decades; different agents have been approved, and newer options are leaning towards higher efficacy and a more favourable safety profile; however, medications approved for a longer time are still available and useful for many patients. This document is an 2024 Update Position Statement of Specialists from the Brazilian Association for the Study of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome (Abeso) and the Brazilian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism (SBEM), with the aim of reviewing all the approved medications for the management of obesity in Brazil (sibutramine, orlistat, liraglutide, semaglutide and bupropion/naltrexone fixed dose), with the addition of tirzepatide, that is approved in other countries and likely approved soon in Brazil. The review is focused on efficacy, safety profile and the impact of drugs (based on existing studies) on different comorbidities.

BACKGROUND
 Elranatamab (ELRA) is a humanized, bispecific antibody that targets B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) on myeloma cells and CD3 on T cells. In the phase 2 registrational MagnetisMM-3 trial (NCT04649359), subcutaneous (SC) ELRA monotherapy induced deep and durable responses in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) naive to BCMA-directed therapy. Here, we report the long-term efficacy and safety of ELRA in BCMA-naive patients approximately 26 months after the last patient initiated treatment, including results after the switch to dosing once every 4 weeks (Q4W).
 METHODS
 Eligible patients had RRMM with disease refractory to ≥1 immunomodulatory drug, ≥1 proteasome inhibitor, and ≥1 anti-CD38 antibody. Patients were given SC ELRA as step-up priming doses followed by ELRA 76 mg QW for 6 cycles. Patients given QW dosing for ≥6 cycles who achieved partial response (PR) or better lasting ≥2 months were transitioned to Q2W dosing and to Q4W after ≥6 cycles of Q2W dosing. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), assessed by blinded-independent central review (BICR) per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. Adverse events (AEs) were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (version 5.0).
 Outcomes in patients who switched to Q4W dosing were assessed in a post-hoc analysis. The impact of Q4W dosing on efficacy was assessed by evaluating maintenance of response ≥6 months after the switch to Q4W. Patients were counted as responders if they had an assessment demonstrating response ≥6 months after the switch. The impact of switching to Q4W dosing on safety was assessed by comparing the incidence of TEAEs before and after the switch. New onset AEs for each participant were included for an equal time period before and after the switch (based on individual follow-up times after the switch), with a maximum time period of up to 6 months.
 RESULTS
 At the time of data cutoff (March 26, 2024), 23 of 123 patients (18.7%) remained on treatment, and 52 (42.3%) were still being followed in the study. After a median follow-up of 28.4 months per reverse Kaplan-Meier, the confirmed ORR was 61.0%, with 46 (37.4%) patients achieving complete response or better (≥CR), 23 (18.7%) VGPR, and 6 (4.9%) PR as best response. Median duration of response (DOR) was not reached (NR); the probability of maintaining a response at 24 months was 66.9% (95% CI, 54.4-76.7). Median DOR among patients with ≥VGPR and ≥CR were NR; the probability of maintaining response at 24 months was 71.5% (95% CI, 58.5-81.1) in patients with ≥VGPR and 87.9% (95% CI, 73.1-94.8) in patients with ≥CR. Median progression-free survival was 17.2 (95% CI, 9.8-NE) months. Median overall survival was 24.6 (95% CI, 13.4-NE) months. A total of 58 patients switched to Q2W dosing; 27 patients further decreased the dosing frequency to Q4W. Among the 58 patients who switched to Q2W dosing, the median time on the Q2W regimen was 13.4 (range, 0.03-22.2) months. In the 27 patients who further decreased the dosing frequency to Q4W, the median time since the switch to Q4W was 6.5 (range, 0.03-10.1) months. Among responders per BICR who switched to Q4W dosing ≥6 months before the data cutoff (n=25), 23 (92.0%) maintained their response ≥6 months after the switch, including 21 (84.0%) who maintained ≥CR. One (4.0%) patient had progressive disease (per IMWG criteria in ≥1 assessment), and 1 (4.0%) permanently discontinued ELRA within 6 months after the switch to Q4W. Among patients who switched to Q4W dosing overall (n=27), the most frequently reported (≥30% either before or after the switch) any grade TEAEs by system organ class (SOC), were infections (51.9% to 59.3%), hematologic disorders (40.7% to 25.9%), respiratory disorders (40.7% to 22.2%), and gastrointestinal disorders (37.0% to 22.2%). The most frequently reported (≥10% either before or after the switch) grade 3/4 TEAEs by SOC were hematologic disorders (33.3% to 25.9%) and infections (18.5% to 11.1%).
 CONCLUSIONS
 Overall, ELRA continues to demonstrate deep and durable responses and no new safety signals after long-term follow-up in a heavily pretreated population (median of 5 prior lines of therapy). These results suggest that reducing the dosing frequency of ELRA to Q4W may improve safety without compromising efficacy. Updated results with data from 32 months after the last patient's initial dose will be presented.

7. [A 2024 scientific update on the clinical performance of drug-coated balloons.](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6aca618dc0c0f0c9e01d970725feeacc2fbf4860)

Continuous advances in the field of interventional cardiology have led to the development of drug-coated balloons (DCB). These represent a promising device for overcoming the well-known limitations of traditional metallic stents, which are associated with a persistent yearly increased risk of adverse events. This technology has the ability to homogeneously transfer the drug into the vessel wall in the absence of a permanent prosthesis implanted in the coronary vessel. Robust data support the use of DCB for the treatment of in-stent restenosis, but there is also currently growing evidence from long-term follow-up of large randomised clinical trials regarding the use of these devices in other scenarios, such as de novo small and large vessel disease, complex bifurcations, and diffuse coronary disease. Other critical clinical settings such as diabetes mellitus, high bleeding risk patients and acute coronary syndromes could be approached in the upcoming future by using DCB, alone or as part of a blended strategy in combination with drug-eluting stents. There have been important scientific and technical advances in the DCB field in recent years. The purpose of this paper is to review the most current data regarding the use of DCB, including the mid- and long-term follow-up reports on the safety and efficacy of this novel strategy in different clinical and angiographic scenarios.

OBJECTIVES
To update evidence on the efficacy and safety of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and provide information to the taskforce for the 2024 update of the Japan College of Rheumatology (JCR) clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).


METHODS
We searched various databases for randomised controlled trials on RA published until June 2022, with no language restriction. For each of the 15 clinical questions, 2 independent reviewers screened the articles, evaluated the core outcomes, and performed meta-analyses.


RESULTS
Subcutaneous injection of methotrexate (MTX) showed similar efficacy to oral MTX in MTX-naïve RA patients. Ozoralizumab combined with MTX improved drug efficacy compared to the placebo in RA patients with inadequate response (IR) to csDMARD. Rituximab with and without concomitant csDMARDs showed similar efficacy to other bDMARDs in bDMARD-IR RA patients. Combined Janus kinase inhibitors and MTX achieved similar clinical responses and equal safety during a 4-year period compared to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in MTX-IR RA patients. Biosimilars showed efficacy equivalent to that of the original bDMARDs in csDMARD-IR and bDMARD-IR RA patients.


CONCLUSION
This systematic review provides latest evidence for the 2024 update of the JCR CPG for RA management.

OBJECTIVES
To update an evidence base informing the 2024 JCR clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in older adults.


METHODS
Four clinical questions (CQs) regarding efficacy and safety of drug treatment were evaluated, with CQ1 addressing methotrexate (MTX), CQ2 biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), CQ3 Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, and CQ4 glucocorticoids (GCs). Quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system.


RESULTS
Observational studies confirmed a pivotal role of MTX in the treatment of older RA patients. The meta-analysis showed that tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and JAK inhibitors were unequivocally effective in older RA patients. No data indicated that bDMARDs were unsafe for older patients. No safety data for JAK inhibitor use in older patients were available. One randomized controlled trial demonstrated that long-term treatment with low-dose GCs increased risks of GC-associated adverse events. The certainty of overall evidence was very low for all CQs.


CONCLUSION
This systematic review provides the necessary evidence for developing 2024 JCR CPGs for managing older patients with RA. Continued updates on the evidence of JAK inhibitors and GC are desired.

10. [A 2024 Update on Menin Inhibitors. A New Class of Target Agents against KMT2A-Rearranged and NPM1-Mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8bc56c7942e7cff779163a58b60b7fd73946aaf2)

Menin inhibitors are new and promising agents currently in clinical development that target the HOX/MEIS1 transcriptional program which is critical for leukemogenesis in histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A-rearranged (KMT2Ar) and in NPM1-mutated (NPM1mut) acute leukemias. The mechanism of action of this new class of agents is based on the disruption of the menin–KMT2A complex (consisting of chromatin remodeling proteins), leading to the differentiation and apoptosis of AML cells expressing KMT2A or with mutated NPM1. To date, this new class of drugs has been tested in phase I and II clinical trials, both alone and in combination with synergistic drugs showing promising results in terms of response rates and safety in heavily pre-treated acute leukemia patients. In this brief review, we summarize the key findings on menin inhibitors, focusing on the mechanism of action and preliminary clinical data on the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia with this promising new class of agents, particularly revumenib and ziftomenib.
