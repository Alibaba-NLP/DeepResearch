Aims Tirzepatide is a novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). At present, there is no controversy over its effectiveness, but its safety. We conducted a systematic review to assess the safety of tirzepatide. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of tirzepatide from databases inception to August 28, 2022 and used the Cochrane Systematic Assessment Manual Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (version 5.1) and modified Jadad scale to assess risk of bias. The systematic review was conducted via Revman5.4. Results Nine RCTs with a total of 9818 patients were included. The overall safety profile of tirzepatide is similar to GLP-1RAs, except for the hypoglycemia (tirzepatide 15mg, pooled RR=3.83, 95% CI [1.19- 12.30], P=0.02) and discontinuation (tirzepatide 10mg, pooled RR=1.75,95%CI[1.16-2.63], P=0.007 and 15mg, pooled RR=2.03, 95%CI [1.37-3.01], P=0.0004). It also showed that the dose escalation could not rise the occurrence rates of total, severe, gastrointestinal adverse events and hypoglycemia (P>0.05); Compared with 5mg, tirzepatide 10mg and 15mg were associated with more frequent nausea (P<0.001), discontinuation (P<0.05) and injection-site reaction (P<0.01); The rates of vomiting and diarrhea were dose-dependence at the range of 5-15mg. Conclusion The safety profile of tirzepatide is generally acceptable, similar to GLP-1 RAs. It is necessary to pay attention to its specific adverse events (hypoglycemia and discontinuation) at high doses (10mg or higher). Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, discontinuation and injection-site reaction were dose-dependence among specific dose ranges.As the heterogeneity in different studies by interventions, the results may be with biases and the further confirmation is needed. Meanwhile, more well-designed trials are needed to control the confounding factors and ensure adequate sample size.

SURPASS trials The incretin hormones, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon line peptide 1 (GLP-1), are responsible for the increased insulin secretion from oral, as compared to intravenous, glucose administration which increases the amount of glucose ingested – known as the ‘incretin effect’. Incretins also slow down the digestion of food so that glucose from your meals takes longer to be absorbed, and thereby appetite is reduced with resulting weight loss. This has been exploited therapeutically by GLP-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP4) inhibitors. SURPASS is an array of double-blind, randomised phase 3 trials studying tirzepatide, a novel dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, a weekly subcutaneous injection in people with type 2 diabetes. The preceding 2018 phase 2 trials showed supportive results leading to much anticipation for this ‘twincretin’. Each trial included four arms of 5mg, 10mg and 15mg tirzepatide and placebo. The primary endpoint was mean change in HbA1c along with secondary outcomes of change in body weight and achieving target HbA1c. SURPASS-11 investigated tirzepatide monotherapy in 478 participants with a short duration of diabetes across 40 weeks (mean baseline HbA1c 63mmol/mol [7.9%], age 54, diabetes duration 4.7years, BMI 31.9kg/m2). HbA1c reductions were 21mmol/mol (1.9%), 21mmol/mol (1.9%) and 23mmol/mol (2%) with 5mg, 10mg and 15mg tirzepatide respectively. A dose dependent weight loss of 7–9.2kg was seen. SURPASS-22 was a 40-week head-to-head study of tirzepatide vs injectable semaglutide in 1879 people with a mean diabetes duration of 8.6 years. Tirzepatide showed improved outcomes with a 23–27mmol/mol (2.1–2.5%) vs 21mmol/mol (1.9%) HbA1c reduction and weight reductions of 7.6–11.2kg vs 5.7kg. Comparatively, the best weight loss seen in the phase 3 semaglutide SUSTAIN-7 trials was 6.5kg (mean baseline 95.2kg, duration of diabetes 7.4 years) and 20mmol/mol (1.8%) HbA1c drop. SURPASS-33 compared tirzepatide against the basal insulin degludec in 1444 participants taking metformin with or without an SGLT2 inhibitor. After 52 weeks, all three tirzepatide arms had decreased bodyweight (-7.5kg to -12.9kg), whereas insulin patients’ bodyweight increased by 2.3kg. Mean tirzepatide HbA1c reduction was 21–25mmol/mol(1.9–2.3%) vs 14mmol/mol (1.3%). The SURPASS-MRI sub-study4 involved participants with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Liver fat content was measured by MRI-proton density fat fraction with an absolute reduction of 8.1% in the pooled 10mg and 15mg tirzepatide groups vs 3.4% with insulin degludec. SURPASS-45 recruited a high cardiovascular risk cohort (87% had a previous event), who had lived with diabetes for a median of 10.5 years and mean HbA1c 69.7mmol/L (8.5%) despite multiple oral antihyperglycaemics. In a head-to-head 52-week trial vs insulin glargine U100, 5mg, 10mg and 15mg doses of tirzepatide led to HbA1c reductions of 24mmol/mol (2.2%), 26mmol/mol (2.4%) and 29mmol/mol (2.6%) respectively vs 15mmol/mol (1.4%) with insulin. At 78 weeks (1166 participants) and 104 weeks (199) the tirzepatide glycaemic and weight benefits were sustained. SURPASS-56 investigated those established on basal insulin with or without metformin over 40 weeks. A total of 475 participants (mean baseline HbA1c 67mmol/mol [8.3%], age 60, diabetes duration 13.4 years, BMI 3.4kg/m2) received either tirzepatide or placebo. Mean HbA1c reductions were 23mmol/mol (2.1%), 26mmol/mol (2.4%), 24mmol/mol (2.3%) vs 10mmol/mol (0.9%) in the placebo arm. Mean body weight reductions of 5.4kg, 7.5kg and 8.8kg compared with an increase of 1.6kg on placebo. Premature treatment discontinuation was high at 10–18% in the intervention arms vs 3% with placebo. Tirzepatide also showed statistically significant improvements in cholesterol in addition to improvements in blood pressure readings. Adverse effects observed across all tirzepatide studies were mainly mild to moderate gastrointestinal based and decreased over time. Clinically significant or severe hypoglycaemia events rates were below 1 per patient-year in all treatment groups but higher in SURPASS-5, understandably due to the combination with basal insulin. The SURPASS series collectively shine a light towards the future of type 2 diabetes treatments, particularly with the present sidelining of incretin-based therapies in the most recent NICE guidelines.7 However, crucial data are expected in 2024 from SURPASS-CVOT, the cardiovascular outcome trial with dulaglutide as a comparator, which will ultimately inform future practices. SURPASS-4 included cardiovascular outcomes with no excess risk Promising outcomes from latest landmark diabetes trials: tirzepatide and finerenone in the spotlight

Abstract Disclosure: A. Arunachalam: None. A. Nguyen: None. N.L. Shah: None. Obesity is a global health challenge which can lead to type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and decreased life expectancy. In addition to lifestyle intervention, pharmacotherapy to sustain weight loss has remained limited due to effectiveness, cost, and adverse effects. Tirzepatide is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonist currently approved for type 2 diabetes treatment. Tirzepatide-induced weight loss may provide new options for treatment of obesity. We report a 32-year-old female with a history of T2DM and PCOS originally on metformin who was started on semaglutide 0.25 mg, which was uptitrated to 0.5mg weekly for 6 months. She lost 25 lbs with no side effects. Semaglutide and OCPs were discontinued due to fertility with her weight and hemoglobin A1C rebounding off medication. She was started on tirzepatide 2.5mg weekly. At that time, she weighed 223 lbs with a hemoglobin A1C 8.2%. She was counseled to resume OCPs and improve glucose control and weight reduction prior to attempting to conceive. Once increased tirzepatide dosing to 5mg weekly, she endorsed severe nausea and intermittent epigastric abdominal pain on day of injection. She attempted to increase dose to 7.5mg weekly, but dose was reduced due to complaints of constipation and worsened abdominal pain requiring bowel regimen. She remained on tirzepatide for a total of 4 months prior to becoming pregnant while on oral contraceptives. Her weight decreased from 223 to 212 lbs with reduction in hemoglobin A1C from 8.2% to 6.1%. While initially studied for use in type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide was found to induce clinically significant weight reduction. The recent SURMOUNT-1 trial, which studied the effects of tirzepatide in non-diabetics, demonstrated that once-weekly tirzepatide at three different doses demonstrated substantial and sustained weight reduction in patients with obesity. In trials involving patients with once-weekly injectable semaglutide, the mean reduction in hemoglobin A1C was 1.8 percentage points and reduction in mean body weight was 6.5 kg. In the SURPASS-2 trial, reductions in body weight were greater with tirzepatide when compared to semaglutide with mean estimated treatment difference −1.9kg, -3.6kg, and -5.5 kg respectively based on dosing of 5mg, 10mg, and 15mg. The adverse events most commonly reported in patients on tirzepatide include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which occurred most commonly during dose-escalation. Mounjaro is known to reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptive pills due to delayed gastric emptying. This delay is largest after the first dose so recommended to switch from oral to non-oral contraceptives for the first four weeks when tirzepatide is initiated. It is important to counsel patients on the decreased efficacy of oral contraceptives while on tirzepatide.  Presentation: Thursday, June 15, 2023

Abstract Disclosure: S. Fansa: None. W. Ghusn: None. B. Nicolalde: None. D. Anazco: None. E. Tama: None. A. Acosta: None. M.D. Hurtado: None. Introduction: The increasing prevalences of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), the “twin epidemics”, have led to the development of drugs targeting both diseases simultaneously. Liraglutide and semaglutide, GLP-1 receptor agonists used for T2DM, are also FDA-approved for weight loss. Tirzepatide, a novel dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for T2D, has shown promising weight loss outcomes in clinical trials. To date, no study has assessed weight loss outcomes of tirzepatide in a real-world setting. Our aim is to assess its efficacy and safety in patients with overweight or obesity. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of adults with overweight or obesity taking weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide for T2D or off-label for weight loss. We excluded patients taking tirzepatide for less than one month, prior bariatric procedure, use of any anti-obesity medications, and active malignancy or pregnancy. The primary outcome was total body weight loss percentage (TBWL%) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included TBWL% at 1 and 2 months; TBWL% difference by T2D status (with and without) and by sex at 3 months; proportion of patients achieving ≥5%, ≥10%, and ≥15% of TBWL% at 3 months; predictors of TBWL% at 3 months; and reported side effects during follow up. We used paired t-test to assess TBWL% compared to baseline, non-paired t-test to compare TBWL% by T2D status and sex, and univariate analyses to estimate the contribution of other variables to TBWL%. Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Results: We included 175 participants (81% female, age 49.8±12.2, 91% white, BMI 38.8±7.3 kg/m2). One third of patients had T2D (n=59, 34%). Most patients were on 5mg (39%) or 7.5mg (22%) of tirzepatide weekly. TBWL% at 1, 2, and 3 months was 3.6±2.5% (n=87), 5.8±3.5% (n=100), and 8.4± 4.3% (n=60), respectively (p <0.0001 compared to baseline at all timepoints). Patients with T2D lost less weight at 3 months compared to patients without T2D: 6.9±4.0% vs. 9.1±4.4% (p= 0.03). At 3 months, TBWL% was greater in females, 9.2±4.3% vs. 5.0±2.5% for males, p<0.0001. Greater baseline weight was associated with greater TBWL% (R=0.32, p<0.0001). At 3 months, 60 patients had documented weights with 81.6% achieving ≥ 5%, 30% achieving ≥10%, and 10% achieving ≥15% TBWL. Forty participants (23%) reported side effects. The most frequent were nausea/vomiting (n=27, 15%), constipation (n=6, 3%), and abdominal pain (n=5, 3%). Eight patients (5%) had to either decrease dosage or discontinue the drug due to side effects. Conclusion: In this retrospective cohort study, tirzepatide led to substantial weight loss at 3 months. Patients with T2DM lost less weight than patients without. Further real-world studies with longer follow-up duration and higher tirzepatide doses are needed to establish the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of this drug in this setting.

5. [A Phase 2 Study of Daratumumab in Combination with Dose-Attenuated Bortezomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone in Transplant Ineligible Older Adults with Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d9ab26b76f9e10778ae2848a94d26f1e8b17f3c1)

Background: Daratumumab (dara), an anti-CD38 mAb, is approved in combination with standard of care regimens for both SCT eligible and ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) pts. The phase 3 MAIA study showed that dara + lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Dara-Rd) vs Rd significantly improved PFS in SCT ineligible NDMM pts. In the phase 3 IMROZ study, the addition of isatuximab, an anti-CD38 mAb, to bortezomib-Rd (VRd) in SCT ineligible NDMM pts also significantly reduced risk of progression or death vs VRd. These data support the use of front-line anti-CD38 mAb based combination regimens in SCT ineligible NDMM. Of note, dosing regimens in these trials included full dose R and dex and twice weekly V, which can be difficult to tolerate in older, frail adults. No data are available on the addition of dara to dose-attenuated VRd in SCT ineligible older adults with NDMM.
 Methods: This is an ongoing single center, phase 2 study of dara + dose-attenuated VRd in SCT ineligible older adults (age ≥ 70) with NDMM by standard criteria (NCT04052880). Pts received an initial twelve 28-day cycles of dara-VRd as follows: dara 1800mg SC QW C1-2, Q2W C3-6, and Q4W thereafter, V 1.3mg/m2 SC D1, 8, 15, R 15mg PO D1-21 (for pts with CrCl 30-60 and 15-30 mL/min, R reduced to 10mg and 5mg, respectively), and dex 20mg QW. After 12 cycles of initial therapy, pts received maintenance with 28-day cycles of dara + R or dara + ixazomib only in pts with t(4;14). Therapy was continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Maintenance dara was discontinued after 2 years, however, if it was deemed that a pt would continue to derive clinical benefit from dara, pt could be taken off study to receive standard of care combination maintenance therapy with dara. The primary endpoint was ≥ VGPR rate. Key secondary endpoints were ≥ CR rate, MRD- (10-5 or 10-6 by flow/NGS) rate, PFS, OS, and predictive value of frailty assessments on outcomes. Adverse events (AEs) were graded with NCI CTCAE v5.0. Here we report an interim analysis after median follow-up of 43.5 mos.
 Results: As of July 30, 2024, 15 pts have been enrolled. Median age was 77.3 y (70.4-87.3), 53.3% were male, 60% ECOG 1, 60% White, 57.1% r-ISS stage II, 28.5% had high risk FISH (defined by t4;14, t14;16, or del17p). 71.4% of pts had IMWG frailty score of ≥ 2 and 57.1% had a gait speed <1 m/s, with 26.7% having a gait speed of <0.8 m/s. Of 14 response evaluable pts, 85.7% (12/14) achieved ≥ VGPR, with 50% achieving ≥ CR. Median time to best response was 6.2 mos [2.3-14.7]. Of the 7 pts in ≥ CR, 4 achieved MRD-. Median time on study was 32.2 mos (1.1- 37.7), with median PFS and DOR not reached. The 24 mo PFS and DOR probability [95% CI] was 0.89 [0.71-1.00] and 0.86 [0.63-1.00], respectively. In 8 pts who completed 12 initial cycles, 2 years of maintenance, then continued on dara-based maintenance therapy off study, median PFS has not been reached, with 48 mo PFS probability 0.71 [0.43-1.00]. Median OS has not been reached (36 mo OS probability 0.91 [0.75-1.00]). The most common (occurring in ≥ 15% of pts) G3/4 TEAEs were lymphopenia (42.8%), neutropenia (28.5%). 14% had G3 infection (PNA and UTI). G1/2 infections occurred in 35.7% of pts. 35.7% developed G1 and 14.2% G2 peripheral neuropathy, 14% developed G2 DVT. 64% (9/14) pts had a dose reduction in 1 or more drugs due to AE, with 6 pts having a reduction in R, 5 in dex, and 1 in V. Two pts had a drug discontinuation due to AE (both R). No pts discontinued study due to AEs. There were no deaths. Among 10 pts with frailty score ≥ 2, 70% had dose reductions while among 3 pts with frailty score <2, 0% had dose reductions (p=0.0699). The probability of CR within 12 mos of therapy was 13% vs 60% for pts with <1m/s vs >1m/s gait speed, respectively (log rank p-value=0.1293). The 12 mo CR rate in frail pts (score ≥2) was 25% vs. 67% in non-frail pts (score <2). Overall, the time to achieving CR was significantly shorter in non-frail vs. frail pts (log rank p-value=0.0348).
 Conclusions: In this frail, older adult transplant ineligible NDMM population, dara + dose-attenuated VRd was well-tolerated without compromise in efficacy. Although trends were noted, the predictive value of frailty assessments on outcomes was limited due to small sample size. Larger trials are warranted to further characterize the risk/benefit profiles of current treatment regimens and to define the predictive value of frailty assessments in this pt population.

Purpose To quantify the preferences of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) for treatment attributes of a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) versus an injectable GLP-1 RA medication profile. Patients and Methods Injection-naive people taking oral medications for T2D in the US and UK completed a web survey including a discrete choice experiment to quantify patients’ preferences for five treatment attributes: delivery system, frequency of nausea, frequency of hypoglycemia, HbA1c reduction, and weight reduction. Attributes and levels were based on head-to-head clinical trial data of tirzepatide 5mg, 10mg, and 15mg versus semaglutide 1mg. Preference data were analyzed separately by country using multinomial mixed logit (MXL) models. MXL parameters were used to estimate the predicted preference for each tirzepatide dose versus semaglutide 1mg. Direct preferences for each dose of tirzepatide versus semaglutide 1mg were elicited. Results Participants (N=620) in the US (N=301) and UK (N=319) were 50.8% and 50.5% female with mean ages of 60.7 years and 58.9 years, respectively. The order and magnitude of relative attribute importance (RAI) scores differed between countries. HbA1c reduction (26.3%) had the greatest impact on US participants’ preferences, and hypoglycemia (32.8%) did among UK participants. Attribute-level marginal utility results indicated preferences for greater HbA1c improvements, the single-use pre-filled pen, lower hypoglycemia, greater weight reductions, and lower frequency of nausea. Assuming the availability of only tirzepatide or semaglutide 1mg, the predicted preference for tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15mg) in the US is 95.6% (vs 4.4% for semaglutide 1mg) and in the UK was 86.3% (vs 13.7% for semaglutide 1mg). Conclusion HbA1c reduction, frequency of hypoglycemia, and weight reduction are key drivers of preferences among people with T2D when considering medication options. Overall, people with T2D are likely to prefer the tirzepatide over the semaglutide 1mg medication profiles.

Corticosteroids (Cs) remain the first-line therapy for moderate-to-severe flares in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), both Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). On the other hand, their use has been associated to multiple adverse events (AEs) in randomized controlled trials and registries. Nevertheless, recent studies have repeatedly observed that the use of Cs has not decreased in spite of the increasing availability of biological agents and new small molecules licensed for IBD. The impact of Cs therapy on patients’ quality of life (QoL) and the patients’ perception on Cs have not been properly assessed in IBD. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of a standard Cs course on the patients’ QoL and their satisfaction with treatment.
 
 
 
 A prospective, longitudinal and observational study was conducted in adult IBD. All subjects received the same standard Cs regimen: starting dose of 1mg/kg/day (maximum 60mg/day) and tapering after 14 days with 10mg per week until reach 20mg/day, thereafter reduction was 5mg per week. QoL was assessed by the IBDQ-9 questionnaire at baseline, week 4 and at the end of Cs. Treatment satisfaction was assessed by the TSQM1.4 questionnaire at week 4 and at the end of Cs.
 
 
 
 Sixty-three patients were included in the study (54% CD and 43% UC; mean age 38.5±14.9 years; 46%females). Cs therapy failed in 41% of cases (active disease upon Cs discontinuation or need for rescue therapy). AEs attributable to Cs were reported in 84.1%, the most frequent were dermatologic (acne and moon face) (60.3%), hypokalemia (44.8%) and poor quality of sleep (40%). Serious AEs were reported in 20,6%, mostly mild or moderate infections that resolved without sequelae. IBDQ-9 scores increased 12.4 and 13.5 points at 4 weeks and at the end of Cs, respectively (p<0.05). Improvement in QoL was not associated with any of the analysed factors (gender, age, type of IBD, response to treatment and AEs). The overall degree of satisfaction with Cs was 68.5 over 100 points, with the highest score related to satisfaction with adverse events (82/100). Satisfaction with treatment was only associated with the achievement of clinical remission or development of steroid dependence.
 
 
 
 A standard Cs course significantly increases the QoL of patients with IBD. Furthermore, a high satisfaction with treatment was perceived by patients.

Introduction:
 Ruxolitinib (RUX) has been approved for 2 nd line therapy or beyond for steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) based on the REACH3 study demonstrating superior efficacy of RUX with respect to greater overall response and failure-free survival (FFS) vs. best available therapies. Despite this, there is no real-world data to evaluate whether the tapering speed used in this study is clinically relevant, or results in successful RUX taper without flare. Accordingly, the present retrospective, multi-center study provides data on RUX tapering in patients who had been successfully treated with RUX for steroid-refractory cGVHD.
 Patients and Methods:
 109 patients treated with RUX to treat chronic GVHD at 4 Canadian transplant centers (Toronto, Calgary, Saskatoon, Quebec City) were enrolled, with patient characteristics in Table 1. The overall response was defined as complete (CR) or partial response (PR) as defined by the 2014 NIH consensus criteria. RUX tapering was started at the treating physician's discretion, while maintaining CR, PR or no change (NC) after complete tapering of steroid. When cGVHD flare is noted during gradual RUX tapering, RUX dose was escalated back to the previous dose level based on physician's discretion. FFS after RUX tapering (R-FFS) was calculated from RUX taper day 1 until either GVHD flare or death from any cause. For risk factor analysis of GVHD flare-up, Cox's proportional hazard model was applied for R-FFS at 24 months.
 Results:
 Of 109 patients enrolled, 70 attempted RUX tapering at median 12.9 months (95% CI [8.9-16.4 months]) following start of RUX therapy after achievement of CR (n=29), PR (n=28) or NC (n=22) with complete discontinuation of steroid in 16 (23%). Daily RUX dose at the time of RUX taper was 30mg (n=4, 5%), 20mg (n=59, 79%), 15mg (n=4, 5%), and 10mg (n=8, 11%).
 Time from start of RUX taper to daily RUX dose of 20mg, 15mg, 10mg and complete discontinuation was 8 ± 6 days, 81 ± 23 days, 185 ± 38 days, and 204 ± 30 days, respectively. In terms of RUX tapering speed, RUX dose was reduced, on average, by 5mg/day every 41 days. With a median follow up duration of 12 months in those who attempted RUX taper, 22 (31%) experienced a cGVHD flare at a median 19.4 months after RUX tapering attempt, while 41 pts (59%) were able to wean RUX completely and 7 pts (13%) remained on tapering schedule. Median time to successful taper was 6.8 months (range 4.6-73.7 months).
 The median R-FFS for RUX taper (95% confidence interval [CI]) to flare was 4.2 years (2.1 - 6.3), while estimated R-FFS at 1 year was 89.1% (0.785 - 0.947%) and at 3 years was 56.0% (39.4-69.7%). Univariate analysis showed that duration of RUX ≥ 434 days prior to taper was associated with lower risk of R-FFS (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.323, 95% C.I. [0.095 - 1.093]), while non-matched related donor was associated with higher risk of R-FFS with HR of 2.826 (1.011 - 7.902). However, multivariate analysis could not confirm these findings.
 There were 9 deaths during RUX taper, including sepsis (n=3), cardiac arrest (n=1), COVID pneumonia (n=1), leukoencephalopathy (n=1) and undetermined causes (n=3), which were not directly related to RUX taper.
 Conclusions:
 Our study provides real-world data that (1) RUX can be successfully tapered with no associated GVHD flare at 12 months median follow up in a majority of this patient population, (2) faster tapering (by 5mg every 6 weeks) demonstrates comparable efficacy to 5mg every 8 weeks (as per REACH3) and (3) factors such as GVHD severity, number of GVHD organ involvement or CR achievement prior to taper were not associated with R-FFS.

Tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule, which recently received NICE approval for the treatment of moderate to severe treatment refractory ulcerative colitis (UC). We present data on the regional experience for it use in relation to its efficacy in a cohort of patients with UC.
 
 
 
 This study analysed a retrospective, cohort from a large IBD unit in the UK. Patients with UC commenced on tofacitinib between 2019 and 2021 for active disease were included. Clinical disease activity was assessed at baseline, week 8, week 16 and during follow up visits. We evaluated clinical response (>50% reduction in symptoms) at week 8, proportion of patients requiring extended of induction therapy to week 16 and need for re-escalation of maintenance dosing.
 
 
 
 A total of 55 patients were included (median age 34 years; IQR 15.75). Twenty six (47.3%) patients had pancolitis, 20 (36.4%) were biologic naïve and 18 (32.7%) were exposed to more than one biologic. Eighteen patients (32.7%) entered clinical response at week 8 and were able to de-escalate to 5mg BD maintenance therapy. Six patients (10.9%) had a primary non response and required a switch to an alternative biologic or a colectomy. Of the patients given an extended induction period (10mg BD for 16 weeks), 7/31 (22.6%) were able to de-escalate to 5mg BD, 15/31 (48.4%) continued on 10mg BD as maintenance and 9/31 (29.0%) discontinued treatment due to lack of clinical response. Of the patients on 5mg BD as maintenance 10/24 (41.6%) required re-escalation to 10mg BD maintenance dosing following a median duration of 10 weeks. Primary non response to tofacitinib were similar in biologic naïve patients compared to biologic exposed patients (25% vs 28.5% respectively). Biologic exposed patients were more likely to need 10mg BD as maintenance dosing compared to biologic naïve patients (72% vs 46.7% respectively).
 
 
 
 Consistent with prior literature, our experience confirms the effectiveness of Tofacitinib in both biologic naive and biologic exposed patients with moderate to severe UC with similar clinical response between the two cohorts. Patients exposed to biologics however appear to have a greater likelihood of escalation to 10mg BD for maintenance therapy.
