## Overview

Evidence-based recommendations on semaglutide (Wegovy) for managing overweight and obesity in adults.

**Last reviewed:** In September 2023, changes were made to recommendation 1.1 to refer to the companyâ€™s commercial arrangement. We also updated section 2 to include the list price of semaglutide and to refer to the commercial arrangement.

**Next review:** This guidance will be reviewed if there is new evidence that is likely to change the recommendations.

### Commercial arrangement

There is a commercial access agreement for semaglutide. NHS organisations can get details on the Commercial Access and Pricing (CAP) Portal. Non-NHS organisations can contact customercare@novonordisk.com for details.

How we develop NICE technology appraisal guidance

#### Your responsibility

The recommendations in this guidance represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, health professionals are expected to take this guidance fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences and values of their patients. The application of the recommendations in this guidance is at the discretion of health professionals and their individual patients and do not override the responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or their carer or guardian.

All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.

Commissioners and/or providers have a responsibility to provide the funding required to enable the guidance to be applied when individual health professionals and their patients wish to use it, in accordance with the NHS Constitution. They should do so in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities.

Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.
