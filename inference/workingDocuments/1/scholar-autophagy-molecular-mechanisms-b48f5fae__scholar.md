Abstract Chaperone‐mediated autophagy (CMA) is a lysosomal degradation pathway that eliminates substrate proteins through heat‐shock cognate protein 70 recognition and lysosome‐associated membrane protein type 2A‐assisted translocation. It is distinct from macroautophagy and microautophagy. In recent years, the regulatory mechanisms of CMA have been gradually enriched, including the newly discovered NRF2 and p38–TFEB signaling, as positive and negative regulatory pathways of CMA, respectively. Normal CMA activity is involved in the regulation of metabolism, aging, immunity, cell cycle, and other physiological processes, while CMA dysfunction may be involved in the occurrence of neurodegenerative disorders, tumors, intestinal disorders, atherosclerosis, and so on, which provides potential targets for the treatment and prediction of related diseases. This article describes the general process of CMA and its role in physiological activities and summarizes the connection between CMA and macroautophagy. In addition, human diseases that concern the dysfunction or protective role of CMA are discussed. Our review deepens the understanding of the mechanisms and physiological functions of CMA and provides a summary of past CMA research and a vision of future directions.

Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic intracellular degradation process. Although the molecular mechanisms of plant autophagy share similarities with those in yeast and mammals, certain unique mechanisms have been identified. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of autophagy during vegetative growth stages as well as in plant-specific developmental processes, such as seed development, germination, flowering, and somatic reprogramming. Autophagy enables plants to adapt to and manage severe environmental conditions, such as nutrient starvation, high-intensity light stress and heat stress, leading to intracellular remodeling and physiological changes in response to stress. In the past, plant autophagy research lagged behind similar studies in yeast and mammals; however, recent advances have greatly expanded our understanding of plant-specific autophagy mechanisms and functions. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge and latest research findings on the mechanisms and roles of plant autophagy with the objective of improving our understanding of this vital process in plants.

Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that participate in ATP generation and involve calcium homeostasis, oxidative stress response, and apoptosis. Dysfunctional or damaged mitochondria could cause serious consequences even lead to cell death. Therefore, maintaining the homeostasis of mitochondria is critical for cellular functions. Mitophagy is a process of selectively degrading damaged mitochondria under mitochondrial toxicity conditions, which plays an essential role in mitochondrial quality control. The abnormal mitophagy that aggravates mitochondrial dysfunction is closely related to the pathogenesis of many diseases. As the myocardium is a highly oxidative metabolic tissue, mitochondria play a central role in maintaining optimal performance of the heart. Dysfunctional mitochondria accumulation is involved in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy and heart failure. This review discusses the most recent progress on mitophagy and its role in cardiovascular disease.

Both apoptosis and autophagy are highly conserved processes that besides their role in the maintenance of the organismal and cellular homeostasis serve as a main target of tumor therapeutics. Although their important roles in the modulation of tumor therapeutic strategies have been widely reported, the molecular actions of both apoptosis and autophagy are counteracted by cancer protective mechanisms. While apoptosis is a tightly regulated process that is implicated in the removal of damaged or unwanted cells, autophagy is a cellular catabolic pathway that is involved in lysosomal degradation and recycling of proteins and organelles, and thereby is considered an important survival/protective mechanism for cancer cells in response to metabolic stress or chemotherapy. Although the relationship between autophagy and cell death is very complicated and has not been characterized in detail, the molecular mechanisms that control this relationship are considered to be a relevant target for the development of a therapeutic strategy for tumor treatment. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis, autophagy, and those of the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy in order to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that may be essential for the balance between cell survival and death as well as their role as targets for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

Autophagy is a degradative mechanism mainly involved in the recycling and turnover of cytoplasmic constituents from eukaryotic cells. Over the last years, yeast genetic screens have considerably increased our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of autophagy, and a number of genes involved in fundamental steps of the autophagic pathway have been identified. Most of these autophagy genes are present in higher eukaryotes indicating that this process has been evolutionarily conserved. In yeast, autophagy is mainly involved in adaptation to starvation, but in multicellular organisms this route has emerged as a multifunctional pathway involved in a variety of additional processes such as programmed cell death, removal of damaged organelles and development of different tissue-specific functions. Furthermore, autophagy is associated with a growing number of pathological conditions, including cancer, myopathies and neurodegenerative disorders. The physiological and pathological roles of autophagy, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying this multifunctional pathway, are discussed in this review.

Over the past decade, the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death (NCCD) has formulated guidelines for the definition and interpretation of cell death from morphological, biochemical, and functional perspectives. Since the field continues to expand and novel mechanisms that orchestrate multiple cell death pathways are unveiled, we propose an updated classification of cell death subroutines focusing on mechanistic and essential (as opposed to correlative and dispensable) aspects of the process. As we provide molecularly oriented definitions of terms including intrinsic apoptosis, extrinsic apoptosis, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)-driven necrosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, parthanatos, entotic cell death, NETotic cell death, lysosome-dependent cell death, autophagy-dependent cell death, immunogenic cell death, cellular senescence, and mitotic catastrophe, we discuss the utility of neologisms that refer to highly specialized instances of these processes. The mission of the NCCD is to provide a widely accepted nomenclature on cell death in support of the continued development of the field.
