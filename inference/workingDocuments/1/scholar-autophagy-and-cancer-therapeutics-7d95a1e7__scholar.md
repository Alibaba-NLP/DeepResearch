Autophagy and apoptosis are functionally distinct mechanisms for cytoplasmic and cellular turnover. While these two pathways are distinct, they can also regulate each other, and central components of the apoptosis or autophagy pathway regulate both processes directly. Furthermore, several upstream stress-inducing signaling pathways can influence both autophagy and apoptosis. The crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis has an integral role in pathological processes, including those related to cancer, homeostasis, and aging. Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death, tightly regulated by various cellular and biochemical mechanisms, some of which have been the focus of drug discovery efforts targeting cancer therapeutics. Autophagy is a cellular degradation pathway whereby cells recycle macromolecules and organelles to generate energy when subjected to stress. Autophagy can act as either a prodeath or a prosurvival process and is both tissue and microenvironment specific. In this review we describe five groups of proteins that are integral to the apoptosis pathway and discuss their role in regulating autophagy. We highlight several apoptosis-inducing small molecules and biologics that have been developed and advanced into the clinic and discuss their effects on autophagy. For the most part, these apoptosis-inducing compounds appear to elevate autophagy activity. Under certain circumstances autophagy demonstrates cytoprotective functions and is overactivated in response to chemo- or radiotherapy which can lead to drug resistance, representing a clinical obstacle for successful cancer treatment. Thus, targeting the autophagy pathway in combination with apoptosis-inducing compounds may be a promising strategy for cancer therapy.

Autophagy is a major catabolic process that maintains cell metabolism by degrading damaged organelles and other dysfunctional proteins via the lysosome. Abnormal regulation of this process has been known to be involved in the progression of pathophysiological diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Although the mechanisms for the regulation of autophagic pathways are relatively well known, the precise regulation of this pathway in the treatment of cancer remains largely unknown. It is still complicated whether the regulation of autophagy is beneficial in improving cancer. Many studies have demonstrated that autophagy plays a dual role in cancer by suppressing the growth of tumors or the progression of cancer development, which seems to be dependent on unknown characteristics of various cancer types. This review summarizes the key targets involved in autophagy and malignant transformation. In addition, the opposing tumor-suppressive and oncogenic roles of autophagy in cancer, as well as potential clinical therapeutics utilizing either regulators of autophagy or combinatorial therapeutics with anti-cancer drugs have been discussed.

Around 1 in 7 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. Many strides have been made in the understanding and treatment of this malignancy over the years, however, despite this; treatment resistance and disease progression remain major clinical concerns. Recent evidence indicate that autophagy can affect cancer formation, progression, and therapeutic resistance. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process that can remove unnecessary or dysfunctional components of the cell as a response to metabolic or environmental stress. Due to the emerging importance of autophagy in cancer, targeting autophagy should be considered as a potential option in disease management. In this review, along with exploring the advances made on understanding the role of autophagy in prostate carcinogenesis and therapeutics, we will critically consider the conflicting evidence observed in the literature and suggest how to obtain stronger experimental evidence, as the application of current findings in clinical practice is presently not viable.

Cancer has become a global health hazard accounting for 10 million deaths in the year 2020. Although different treatment approaches have increased patient overall survival, treatment for advanced stages still suffers from poor clinical outcomes. The ever-increasing prevalence of cancer has led to a reanalysis of cellular and molecular events in the hope to identify and develop a cure for this multigenic disease. Autophagy, an evolutionary conserved catabolic process, eliminates protein aggregates and damaged organelles to maintain cellular homeostasis. Accumulating evidence has implicated the deregulation of autophagic pathways to be associated with various hallmarks of cancer. Autophagy exhibits both tumor-promoting and suppressive effects based on the tumor stage and grades. Majorly, it maintains the cancer microenvironment homeostasis by promoting viability and nutrient recycling under hypoxic and nutrient-deprived conditions. Recent investigations have discovered long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as master regulators of autophagic gene expression. lncRNAs, by sequestering autophagy-related microRNAs, have been known to modulate various hallmarks of cancer, such as survival, proliferation, EMT, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. This review delineates the mechanistic role of various lncRNAs involved in modulating autophagy and their related proteins in different cancers.

Simple Summary Autophagy and mitophagy are important processes in the regulation of cancer progression. Although autophagy and mitophagy have dual roles in cancer, targeting their regulation has potential for developing an effective cancer treatment strategy. Thus, it is important to understand how ubiquitination and deubiquitination of autophagy-related proteins are regulated to exploit autophagy and mitophagy during cancer development. Abstract Autophagy is essential for organismal development, maintenance of energy homeostasis, and quality control of organelles and proteins. As a selective form of autophagy, mitophagy is necessary for effectively eliminating dysfunctional mitochondria. Both autophagy and mitophagy are linked with tumor progression and inhibition. The regulation of mitophagy and autophagy depend upon tumor type and stage. In tumors, mitophagy has dual roles: it removes damaged mitochondria to maintain healthy mitochondria and energy production, which are necessary for tumor growth. In contrast, mitophagy has been shown to inhibit tumor growth by mitigating excessive ROS production, thus preventing mutation and chromosomal instability. Ubiquitination and deubiquitination are important modifications that regulate autophagy. Multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases and DUBs modulate the activity of the autophagy and mitophagy machinery, thereby influencing cancer progression. In this review, we summarize the mechanistic association between cancer development and autophagy/mitophagy activities regulated by the ubiquitin modification of autophagic proteins. In addition, we discuss the function of multiple proteins involved in autophagy/mitophagy in tumors that may represent potential therapeutic targets.

Simple Summary Autophagy is a cellular self-eating process that uses lysosome, the waste disposal system of the cell, to degrade and recycle intracellular materials to maintain cellular homeostasis. Defects in autophagy are linked to a variety of pathological states, including cancer. Calcium is an important cellular messenger that regulates the survival of all animal cells. Alterations to calcium homoeostasis are associated with cancer. While it has long been considered as cellular recycling center, the lysosome is now widely known as an intracellular calcium store that regulates autophagy and cancer progression by releasing calcium via some ion channels residing in the lysosomal membrane. In this review, we summarize existing mechanisms of autophagy regulation by lysosomal calcium channels and their implications in cancer development. We hope to guide readers toward a more in-depth understanding of the importance of lysosomal calcium channels in cancer, and potentially facilitate the development of new therapeutics for some cancers. Abstract Ca2+ is pivotal intracellular messenger that coordinates multiple cell functions such as fertilization, growth, differentiation, and viability. Intracellular Ca2+ signaling is regulated by both extracellular Ca2+ entry and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Apart from working as the cellular recycling center, the lysosome has been increasingly recognized as a significant intracellular Ca2+ store that provides Ca2+ to regulate many cellular processes. The lysosome also talks to other organelles by releasing and taking up Ca2+. In lysosomal Ca2+-dependent processes, autophagy is particularly important, because it has been implicated in many human diseases including cancer. This review will discuss the major components of lysosomal Ca2+ stores and their roles in autophagy and human cancer progression.

The global incidence of cancer and cancer‐related mortality is expected to rise in recent years despite advancements in cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. Increasing evidences of decrypting molecular mechanisms underlying cancer progression have commanded the tremendous development of synthetic anticancer drugs. With limitations in the current conventional cancer therapeutic approaches, the non‐nutritive dietary phytochemicals have emerged as potent modulators of apoptosis and autophagy associated key signaling pathways in various cancer cells. The dynamic regulation of apoptosis and autophagy by phytochemicals in cancer are identified as promising therapeutic candidates with minimal cytotoxicity and enhanced biological activity. Dietary phytochemicals and their synthetic analogs have exhibited potency in the modulation of apoptosis and autophagy in several cancer cells as individuals or in combination with pre‐existing FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved anticancer drugs. In the current generation of medical science, developing precision and personalized medicine and their consumption as food supplements will hold high prevalence in cancer therapeutics. Hence understating the impact of dietary phytochemicals on human health and their molecular mechanism will thrive a new horizon in cancer therapeutics. Hence, this review has emphasized the role of apoptotic/autophagy modulating dietary phytochemicals in cancer therapy, their preclinical and clinical applications and the future direction of enhanced nano‐formulation for better clinical efficacy.
