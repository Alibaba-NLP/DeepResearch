Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective proteolytic pathway in the lysosomes. Proteins are recognized one by one through the detection of a KFERQ motif or, at least, a KFERQ-like motif, by a heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70), a molecular chaperone. CMA substrates are recognized and delivered to a lysosomal CMA receptor, lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP-2A), the only limiting component of this pathway, and transported to the lysosomal lumen with the help of another resident chaperone HSp90. Since approximately 75% of proteins are reported to have canonical, phosphorylation-generated, or acetylation-generated KFERQ motifs, CMA maintains intracellular protein homeostasis and regulates specific functions in the cells in different tissues. CMA also regulates physiologic functions in different organs, and is then implicated in disease pathogenesis related to aging, cancer, and the central nervous and immune systems. In this minireview, we have summarized the most important findings on the role of CMA in tissue homeostasis and disease pathogenesis, updating the recent advances for this Special Issue.

Lung disease development involves multiple cellular processes, including inflammation, cell death, and proliferation. Research increasingly indicates that autophagy and its regulatory proteins can influence inflammation, programmed cell death, cell proliferation, and innate immune responses. Autophagy plays a vital role in the maintenance of homeostasis and the adaptation of eukaryotic cells to stress by enabling the chelation, transport, and degradation of subcellular components, including proteins and organelles. This process is essential for sustaining cellular balance and ensuring the health of the mitochondrial population. Recent studies have begun to explore the connection between autophagy and the development of different lung diseases. This article reviews the latest findings on the molecular regulatory mechanisms of autophagy in lung diseases, with an emphasis on potential targeted therapies for autophagy.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) comprise a diverse group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, cytopenia in the peripheral blood, and an increased risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Despite extensive research, the mechanisms underlying MDS pathogenesis remain unclear. In the present study, we explored the role of autophagy and apoptosis in the development of MDS and assessed the impact of azacitidine on these processes in vitro. First, we assessed the expression of proteins involved in both autophagic and apoptotic pathways in MDS patients with different prognoses. Furthermore, using the MDS-L cell line as a model, we investigated the in vitro effects of azacitidine treatment on these processes. We report that MDS, irrespective of risk classification, is associated with the dysregulation of autophagy and apoptosis. Notably, azacitidine treatment restored these cellular processes, accompanied by modulation of key signaling phosphoproteins. Overall, these findings provide evidence that impaired autophagy and apoptosis contribute to MDS pathogenesis and that azacitidine helps restore cellular homeostasis by activating both processes. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting these mechanisms and suggests that combining azacitidine with agents that modulate autophagy and apoptosis could enhance the treatment efficacy for MDS patients.

Stroke represents a main cause of death and permanent disability worldwide. The molecular mechanisms underlying cerebral injury in response to the ischemic insults are not completely understood. In this article, we summarize recent evidence regarding the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke by reviewing data obtained in murine models of either transient or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, and in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat. Few preliminary observational studies investigating the role of autophagy in subjects at high cerebrovascular risk and in cohorts of stroke patients were also reviewed. Autophagy plays a dual role in neuronal and vascular cells by exerting both protective and detrimental effects depending on its level, duration of stress and type of cells involved. Protective autophagy exerts adaptive mechanisms which reduce neuronal loss and promote survival. On the other hand, excessive activation of autophagy leads to neuronal cell death and increases brain injury. In conclusion, the evidence reviewed suggests that a proper manipulation of autophagy may represent an interesting strategy to either prevent or reduce brain ischemic injury.
