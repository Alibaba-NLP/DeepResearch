It has been thought that caloric restriction favors longevity and healthy aging where autophagy plays a vital role. However, autophagy decreases during aging and that can lead to the development of aging-associated diseases such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegeneration, etc. It was shown that autophagy can be induced by mechanical or chemical stress. In this regard, various pharmacological compounds were proposed, including natural polyphenols. Apart from the ability to induce autophagy, polyphenols, such as resveratrol, are capable of modulating the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, neutralizing free radical species, affecting mitochondrial functions, chelating redox-active transition metal ions, and preventing protein aggregation. Moreover, polyphenols have advantages compared to chemical inducers of autophagy due to their intrinsic natural bio-compatibility and safety. In this context, polyphenols can be considered as a potential therapeutic tool for healthy aging either as a part of a diet or as separate compounds (supplements). This review discusses the epigenetic aspect and the underlying molecular mechanism of polyphenols as an anti-aging remedy. In addition, the recent advances of studies on NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) regulation of autophagy, the role of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in cells senescence and their regulation by polyphenols have been highlighted as well. Apart from that, the review also revised the latest information on how polyphenols can help to improve mitochondrial function and modulate apoptosis (programmed cell death).

Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective autophagic pathway that targets specific proteins for lysosomal degradation, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Recent research has highlighted the involvement of CMA in aging and age-related diseases, yet its regulation remains complex. The study by Khawaja et al. provides novel insights into the sex-specific and cell-type-specific regulation of CMA during aging. This commentary discusses the key findings of this study, their implications for autophagy and aging research, and potential future directions. Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is essential for developing targeted therapies to combat age-related diseases and promote healthy aging.

As our society ages inexorably, geroscience and research focusing on healthy aging is becoming increasingly urgent. Macroautophagy (referred to as autophagy), a highly conserved process of cellular clearance and rejuvenation has attracted much attention due to its universal role in organismal life and death. Growing evidence points to autophagy process as being one of the key players in the determination of lifespan and health. Autophagy inducing interventions show significant improvement in organismal lifespan demonstrated in several experimental models. In line with this, preclinical models of age-related neurodegenerative diseases demonstrate pathology modulating effect of autophagy induction, implicating its potential to treat such disorders. In humans this specific process seems to be more complex. Recent clinical trials of drugs targeting autophagy point out some beneficial effects for clinical use, although with limited effectiveness, while others fail to show any significant improvement. We propose that using more human-relevant preclinical models for testing drug efficacy would significantly improve clinical trial outcomes. Lastly, the review discusses the available cellular reprogramming techniques used to model neuronal autophagy and neurodegeneration while exploring the existing evidence of autophagy’s role in aging and pathogenesis in human-derived in vitro models such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons (iPSC-neurons) or induced neurons (iNs).

Objective By establishing a resistance training model, the researchers observed the effects of resistance exercise on the endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial autophagy-related factors in aging rats and further discussed the physiological mechanism of resistance movement in preventing and delaying senile skeletal muscle decay . 
Methods 20 adult rats and 20 aged rats were randomly divided into two groups. The adult group was divided into the control Group C and the Sports Group E Group, the elderly group were divided into the control group OC Group and the Sports Group OE Group, 10/group. The eight-week tail-loading ladder training method was used to intervene the suitable resistance training for rats in the exercise group. During this period, rats in the control group did not exercise any training activities and ate normally. The relative expression of PINK1, PARKIN, LC3, PERK/EIF2A and Caspase-12 mRNA in gastrocnemius muscle of rats were detected by quantitative PCR after the experiment. The expression of Pink1/parkin protein in gastrocnemius muscle of rats was detected by Western Blot method. High performance liquid chromatography was performed to detect the ATP production of rat gastrocnemius mitochondria, and the obtained data were collected and analyzed. 
Results (1) Compared with group C, the expression of PINK1 protein and parkin protein of gastrocnemius muscle in OC Group decreased significantly (p<0.05). PINK1 protein and Parkin protein in OE Group increased significantly (p<0.01) compared with OC Group.(2) Compared with group C, the expression of Pink1mRNA, PARKIN mRNA and Lc3 mRNA in OC group showed a downward trend (p<0.05), and the expression of Pink1 mRNA, PARKIN mRNA and Lc3 mRNA in Group E showed an ascending trend (p<0.01). Compared with OC , the expression of Pink1 mRNA, PARKIN mRNA and Lc3 mRNA in OE group increased and had significant difference (p<0.01).(3) Compared with group C, the expression levels of perk mRNA, eif2a mRNA and Caspase-12 mRNA in the gastrocnemius of rats in Group E were significantly lower (p<0.01), and the expression of perk mRNA in OC Group had a significant upward trend (p<0.05). Compared with OC Group , the expression levels of perk mRNA, eif2a mRNA and Caspase-12 mRNA in OE group showed significant decrease (p<0.01).(4) There was a small increase in mitochondrial ATP production in Group E rats and Group C, but there was no significant difference. The mitochondrial ATP production in Group C was significantly higher than that in OC Group, and had significant difference (p<0.01). After 8 weeks ' training, the mitochondrial function of the OE group was restored to normal, and the ATP production in the OC group increased significantly, there was significant difference (p<0.05). 
Conclusions The resistance training can improve the function of mitochondria and activate the autophagy, which can improve the abnormality of mitochondria autophagy caused by skeletal muscle decay. Resistance training can reduce the extent of endoplasmic reticulum stress, suggesting that skeletal muscle decay can be slowed down by prolonged exercise.

Microglia harness an unutilized health-promoting potential in age-related neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, conditions like progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Our research unveils an microglia population emerging in the cortical brain regions of aging mice, marked by ERK1/2, Akt, and AMPK phosphorylation patterns and a transcriptome indicative of activated autophagy - a process critical for cellular adaptability. By deleting the core autophagy gene Ulk1 in microglia, we reduce this population in the central nervous system of aged mice. Notably, this population is found dependent on IL-34, rather than CSF1, although both are ligands for CSF1R. When aging mice are exposed to autoimmune neuroinflammation, the loss of autophagy-dependent microglia leads to neural and glial cell death and increased mortality. Conversely, microglial expansion mediated by IL-34 exhibits a protective effect. These findings shed light on an autophagy-dependent neuroprotective microglia population as a potential target for treating age-related neuroinflammatory conditions, including progressive MS. Microglia could have health-promoting capacities in age-associated neuroinflammation. Here, the authors describe an autophagy and IL-34 dependent neuroprotective microglia population in the aging brain as a potential therapeutic target.

Entropy is a natural process that affects all living cells, including senescence, an irreversible physiological process that impairs cell homeostasis. Age is a significant factor in disease development, and the pathogenesis of endothelial cell aging is multifactorial. Autophagy dysfunction accelerates endothelial cell aging and cell death, while autophagy preserves endothelial cell youthfulness through intracellular homeostasis and gene expression regulation. Sirt, mTORC1, and AMPK are youthfulness genes that induce autophagy by inhibiting mTOR and upregulating FIP200/Atg13/ULK1. Aged endothelial cells have decreased levels of Lamin B1, γH2AX, Ki67, BrdU, PCNA, and SA β-Gal. Maintaining healthy young endothelial cells can prevent most cardiovascular diseases. Autophagy targeting is a potential future therapeutic strategy to modify endothelial cell age and potentially slow or reverse the aging process. This article provides state-of-the-art research on the role of autophagy in endothelial cell aging. Hypothesizing that autophagy dysregulation is associated with early endothelial cell dysfunction and further clinical sequelae, including atherosclerosis formation, leading to various cardiovascular diseases.

Old age leads to cellular maintenance decline, disrupting homeostasis and increasing disease risks, including cancer. Aging-related autophagy impairments contribute to harmful protein accumulation, reduced hematopoietic cell self-renewal, and impaired mitochondrial function. Autophagy plays a central role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and key cellular functions, such as cell death, cell cycle control, and differentiation. This research aims to investigate how aging-related microenvironmental changes influence Tet2 clonal hematopoiesis (CH) development, with a focus on understanding the roles of aging-associated autophagy changes. We hypothesize that the decline in cellular and tissue maintenance during aging, characterized by reduced autophagy function, contributes to changes in the bone marrow microenvironment. These changes, in turn, create a milieu conducive to the selection of oncogenic mutations. To test this hypothesis, we aimed to boost autophagy in older mice to investigate if it can mitigate oncogenesis, given that CH and cancers are less common in young individuals but prevalent in the elderly. 15-month-old mice were treated with a spermidine supplemented diet for 3 months, then LSK were transplanted with fluorescently tagged, CRISPR induced Tet2 mutations such that a small percent of HSPC bear mutations. We then monitored the competitive expansion of cells with Tet2. We found that old mice supplemented with spermidine show decreased Tet2 selection within the HSPC compartment similar to young (2mo) mice and compared to old mice on a control diet. We plan to test Tet2 competitive expansion in aged transgenic mice with high autophagy as well as the opposite experiment using transgenic young mice with decreased autophagy to further support our hypothesis. Our research emphasizes the role of autophagy in shaping the bone marrow microenvironment and influencing the development of CH. By examining how aging-associated changes in autophagy impact the selection of oncogenic mutations, our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between aging and cancer development. Our research has the potential to impact cancer treatment and the understanding of cancer evolution by shedding light on the mechanisms that drive oncogenic adaptation in the context of aging. Specifically, our findings suggest that enhancing autophagy in older individuals may mitigate the selection of oncogenic mutations, potentially reducing cancer risk. This insight could inform future therapeutic strategies for cancer prevention and treatment, especially in the elderly population. In summary, our research unveils the role of autophagy in modulating the aging bone marrow microenvironment's impact on CH development. By boosting autophagy in aged mice and observing reduced Tet2 selection, we provide evidence that autophagy plays a crucial role in shaping the oncogenic landscape. This underscores the potential of autophagy-enhancing interventions in countering age-related oncogenic effects.

Aging is the time-dependent process that all living organisms go through characterized by declining physiological function due to alterations in metabolic and molecular pathways. Many decades of research have been devoted to uncovering the cellular changes and progression of aging and have revealed that not all organisms with the same chronological age exhibit the same age-related declines in physiological function. In assessing biological age, factors such as epigenetic changes, telomere length, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction in rescue mechanisms such as autophagy all play major roles. Recent studies have focused on autophagy dysfunction in aging, particularly on mitophagy due to its major role in energy generation and reactive oxidative species generation of mitochondria. Mitophagy has been implicated in playing a role in the pathogenesis of many age-related diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The purpose of our article is to highlight the mechanisms of autophagy and mitophagy and how defects in these pathways contribute to the physiological markers of aging and AD. This article also discusses how mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal mitochondrial dynamics, impaired biogenesis, and defective mitophagy are related to aging and AD progression. This article highlights recent studies of amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau in relation to autophagy and mitophagy in AD.

Autophagy is a crucial cellular process that facilitates the degradation of damaged organelles and protein aggregates, and the recycling of cellular components for the energy production and macromolecule synthesis. It plays an indispensable role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Over recent decades, research has increasingly focused on the role of autophagy in regulating adult stem cells (SCs). Studies suggest that autophagy modulates various cellular processes and states of adult SCs, including quiescence, proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation. The primary role of autophagy in these contexts is to sustain homeostasis, withstand stressors, and supply energy. Notably, the dysfunction of adult SCs during aging is correlated with a decline in autophagic activity, suggesting that autophagy is also involved in SC- and aging-associated disorders. Given the diverse cellular processes mediated by autophagy and the intricate mechanisms governing adult SCs, further research is essential to elucidate both universal and cell type-specific regulatory pathways of autophagy. This review discusses the role of autophagy in regulating adult SCs during quiescence, proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation. Additionally, it summarizes the relationship between SC aging and autophagy, providing therapeutical insights into treating and ameliorating aging-associated diseases and cancers, and ultimately promoting longevity.
