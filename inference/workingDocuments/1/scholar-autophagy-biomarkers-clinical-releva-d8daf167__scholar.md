BACKGROUND
Autophagy is a self-renewing process of the cell having a dual role in gliomagenesis depending on the tumor stage. Several microRNAs play a key role in the regulation of autophagy and the outcome of cancer. We investigated the potential relevance of autophagy in gliomagenesis and survival by exploring the association of the basal gene expression of autophagy-associated markers LC3, ULK1/2, UVRAG, Beclin1, mTOR, UVRAG, PI3K, AKT, PTEN and their target microRNAs miR-126, miR-374, miR-21, miR-7, miR-204 and miR-100 in low- and high-grades of gliomas.


METHODS
A total of 50 fresh glioma tissues were used for the extraction of RNA using TRIzol-Chloroform method and reverse transcribed cDNA. The cDNA was used to determine the expression of genes and microRNAs using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Mann-Whitney U-test was used to determine the statistical significance.


RESULTS
In high-grade glioma, increased expression of AKT and miR-21, coupled with reduced ULK2 and LC3 expression was distinctly observed. While correlation analysis identified a strong positive correlation between ULK2 and UVRAG, PTEN, miR-7, and miR-100 and a moderate positive correlation emerged between ULK2 and mTOR, miR-7, miR-30, miR-100, miR-204, and miR-374, also between miR-21 and miR-126 in low-grade glioma. Similarly, a positive correlation appeared between ULK2 and AKT, LC3, PI3K, PTEN, ULK1, VPS34, mTOR, Beclin1, UVRAG, miR-7 and miR-374. AKT positively correlated with LC3, PI3K, PTEN, ULK1, VPS34, mTOR, Beclin1, UVRAG, miR-7, miR-30, miR-204, miR-374, miR-126 and miR-21 weakly correlated with AKT and miR-30 in high-grade glioma. The low ULK2, UVRAG, and miR-374 expression group exhibited significantly poor overall survival in glioma, while miR-21 over-expression indicated a poor prognosis in glioma patients.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides comprehensive insights into the molecular landscape of gliomas, highlighting the dysregulation of autophagy genes ULK2, and UVRAG and the associated miR-21, miR-126 and miR-374 as potential prognostic biomarkers and emphasizing their unique significance in shaping survival outcomes in gliomas patients.

The β-thalassemias are inherited genetic disorders affecting the hematopoietic system. In β-thalassemias, more than 350 mutations of the adult β-globin gene cause the low or absent production of adult hemoglobin (HbA). A clinical parameter affecting the physiology of erythroid cells is the excess of free α-globin. Possible experimental strategies for a reduction in excess free α-globin chains in β-thalassemia are CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing of the β-globin gene, forcing “de novo” HbA production and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction. In addition, a reduction in excess free α-globin chains in β-thalassemia can be achieved by induction of the autophagic process. This process is regulated by the Unc-51-like kinase 1 (Ulk1) gene. The interplay with the PI3K/Akt/TOR pathway, with the activity of the α-globin stabilizing protein (AHSP) and the involvement of microRNAs in autophagy and Ulk1 gene expression, is presented and discussed in the context of identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for β-thalassemia.

Background Recently, autophagy was found related to several malignances. Methods To explore the diagnostic and prognostic values of autophagy in prostate cancer (PCa), we first identified differentially expressed autophagy-related genes (DEARGs) based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Prostate Adenocarcinoma (PRAD) dataset. Gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were applied to perform gene functional annotation. Then, multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to construct the risk index (RI). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC), calibration and decision curve analysis (DCA) curves were performed to identify the effectiveness of RI. Next, multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to construct the prognostic index (PI) and autophagy-clinical prognostic index (ACPI). Results We identified 16 DEARGs and functional annotation demonstrated the relevance of these genes to autophagy and revealed the association of these DEARGs with digestive system, drug resistance and apoptosis. Then, the RI was constructed based on 5 DEARGs and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.9858. Validation based on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets suggested that the RI was effective. Next, 7 ARGs were identified associated with overall survival (OS) and the PI was developed composed of 3 ARGs. Finally, ACPI was constructed based on PI and the M stage. Conclusions This study provided potential models for predicting the risk and prognosis of PCa and indicated the molecular insights of autophagy in PCa. While no other dataset was applied to test the effectiveness of the PI and ACPI models attribute to the well prognosis of PCa.

Background Autophagy related protease 4B (ATG4B) is a protease required for autophagy processing, which is strongly implicated in cancer progression.  Phosphorylation of ATG4B is crucial for activation of its protease activity.  However, little is known about the relationship of ATG4B and its phosphorylated form at Ser 383 and 392 sites (pS383/392-ATG4B), with clinical outcomes, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods The  ATG4B  gene expression in CRC patients was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to analyze its clinical relevance. Tissue microarrays composed of 118 CRC patient specimens were used to determine the associations of ATG4B and pS383/392-ATG4B protein levels with prognosis. The biological functions of ATG4B in CRC cells were inspected with cell proliferation, mobility and spheroid culture assays. Results ATG4B  gene expression was elevated in tumor tissues of CRC patients compared to that in adjacent normal tissues and high level of  ATG4B  expression was associated with poor survival. Similarly, protein levels of ATG4B and pS383/392-ATG4B were highly correlated with worse overall survival and disease-free survival. Stratification analysis results showed that high level of ATG4B had significantly higher risk of mortality in males and elderly patients compared to those female patients and patients 60 years or younger. In contrast, multivariate Cox’s regression analysis indicated that high level of pS383/392-ATG4B was significantly linked to unfavorable overall survival and disease-free survival of males and elderly patients, whereas, it had no correlation with female patients and patients 60 years or younger. Moreover, high level of ATG4B was positively associated with increased mortality risk in patients with advanced AJCC stages (III and IV) and lymph node invasion (N1 and N2) for both overall survival and disease-free survival. Nevertheless, high level of pS383/392-ATG4B was positively correlated with increased mortality risk in patients with early AJCC stages (I and II) and without lymph node invasion (N0). In addition, silencing ATG4B attenuated migration, invasion, and further enhanced the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs in two and three-dimensional cultures of CRC cells. Conclusions Our results suggest that ATG4B and pS383/392-ATG4B might be suitable biomarkers and therapeutic targets for CRC.

This paper reviews the perspectives of proteomic analysis of tear and aqueous humor to determine biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of eye disorders. The methodology of sample collection and the advantages and disadvantages of the available methods are discussed in detail. The results of proteomic mapping of tear and aqueous humor in dry eye disease, keratoconus, glaucoma, cataract, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy are described. The association between the levels of identified proteins and their role in triggering pathological processes, e.g., oxidative stress with autophagy (and, as a result, tissue dystrophy), initiation of inflammation, and impairment of metabolic processes at the molecular level with activation of pathological proteolysis (that ultimately lead to cellular and tissue changes with the development of the above-mentioned diseases) are of particular importance. This paper also emphasizes the practical relevance of using proteomics to study the pathogenesis of eye diseases, which implies determining the association between genotype and phenotype of a patient in clinical practice with further treatment personalization. Proteomics also provides an early noninvasive diagnosis of socially significant eye diseases. KEYWORDS: proteomic analysis, tear, aqueous humor, mass spectrometry, eye disorders.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the major leading causes of cancer death worldwide due to the limited availability of biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Autophagy related protease 4B (ATG4B) is an essential protease for the autophagy machinery, and ATG4B phosphorylation at Ser383/392 increases its proteolytic activity. ATG4B expression and activation are crucial for cancer cell proliferation and invasion. However, the clinical relevance of ATG4B and phospho-Ser383/392-ATG4B for OSCC remains unknown, particularly in buccal mucosal SCC (BMSCC) and tongue SCC (TSCC). With a tissue microarray comprising specimens from 428 OSCC patients, including 179 BMSCC and 249 TSCC patients, we found that the protein levels of ATG4B and phospho-Ser383/392-ATG4B were elevated in the tumor tissues of BMSCC and TSCC compared with those in adjacent normal tissues. High protein levels of ATG4B were significantly associated with worse disease-specific survival (DSS) in OSCC patients, particularly in patients with tumors at advanced stages. In contrast, phospho-Ser383/392-ATG4B expression was correlated with poor disease-free survival (DFS) in TSCC patients. Moreover, ATG4B protein expression was positively correlated with phospho-Ser383/392-ATG4B expression in both BMSCC and TSCC. However, high coexpression levels of ATG4B and phospho-Ser383/392-ATG4B were associated with poor DFS only in TSCC patients, whereas they had no significant association with DSS in BMSCC and TSCC patients. In addition, silencing ATG4B with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) diminished cell proliferation of TW2.6 and SAS oral cancer cells. Further, knockdown of ATG4B reduced cell migration and invasion of oral cancer cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that ATG4B might be a biomarker for diagnosis/prognosis of OSCC and a potential therapeutic target for OSCC patients.

Chromosome 8q24 is of particular importance for cancer susceptibility. Located in this region is the Plasmacytoma Variant Translocation 1 (PVT1) gene, a long noncoding RNA that has been implicated in multiple cancers including prostate cancer. Amplification of the PVT1 gene locus is a common event in many malignant diseases and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. The pioneering role of PVT1, and its alternatively spliced transcripts, as a cancer biomarker is progressively becoming established. We have demonstrated that copy numbers of PVT1 exons 4A, 4B and 9 is quantifiable in cancer cells, tissue, and serum from cancer patients. In this study, we assessed clinically annotated serum samples from 40 prostate cancer patients to investigate the clinical relevance of PVT1 exons 4A, 4B, and 9 as a biomarker across cancer risk levels and ethnicity/race. Explorative data analysis for the development of composite score for prostate cancer was performed using Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum Test. We observed significantly higher copy numbers of PVT1 exons 4B and 9 across all races (White, Black and Hispanic) and Blacks and Hispanics when compared to the control. Additionally, using a 3-level cancer risk rating assessment in which 0 = healthy, 1 = low risk and 2 = high risk, we observed that PVT1 exon 9 may distinguish between cancerous and noncancerous cases across all races, but may not help distinguish between indolent and aggressive cancer cases. Notably, PVT1 exon 4B may help distinguish between indolent and aggressive cancer cases for Blacks and Hispanics. The results of this study suggest that using PVT1 exon 4B or 9 may identify cancer regardless of ethnicity/race, and that utilization of serum PVT1 exon 4B copy number may help distinguish between indolent and aggressive prostate cancer in Blacks and Hispanics.

Purpose: Radiation-induced cardiotoxicity is a significant concern in thoracic oncology patients. However, the basis for this disease pathology is not well characterized. We developed a novel mouse model of radiation-induced cardiotoxicity to investigate pathophysiologic mechanisms and identify clinically targetable biomarkers of cardiac injury. Experimental Design: Single radiation doses of 20, 40, or 60 Gy were delivered to the cardiac apex of female C57BL/6 mice ages 9–11 weeks, with or without adjacent lung tissue, using conformal radiotherapy. Cardiac tissue was harvested up to 24 weeks post-radiotherapy for histologic analysis. Echocardiography and Technetium-99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) at 8 and 16 weeks post-radiotherapy were implemented to evaluate myocardial function and perfusion. Mouse cardiac tissue and mouse and human plasma were harvested for biochemical studies. Results: Histopathologically, radiotherapy resulted in perivascular fibrosis 8 and 24 (P < 0.05) weeks post-radiotherapy. Apical perfusion deficits on SPECT and systolic and diastolic dysfunction on echocardiography 8 and 16 weeks post-radiotherapy were also observed (P < 0.05). Irradiated cardiac tissue and plasma showed significant increases in placental growth factor (PlGF), IL6, and TNFα compared with nonradiated matched controls, with greater increases in cardiac cytokine levels when radiotherapy involved lung. Human plasma showed increased PlGF (P = 0.021) and TNFα (P = 0.036) levels after thoracic radiotherapy. PlGF levels demonstrated a strong correlation (r = 0.89, P = 0.0001) with mean heart dose. Conclusions: We developed and characterized a pathophysiologically relevant mouse model of radiation-induced cardiotoxicity involving in situ irradiation of the cardiac apex. The model can be used to integrate radiomic and biochemical markers of cardiotoxicity to inform early therapeutic intervention and human translational studies.
