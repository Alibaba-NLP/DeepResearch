The complicated stepwise lysosomal degradation process known as autophagy is in charge of destroying and eliminating damaged organelles and defective cytoplasmic components. This mechanism promotes metabolic adaptability and nutrition recycling. Autophagy functions as a quality control mechanism in cells that support homeostasis and redox balance under normal circumstances. However, the role of autophagy in cancer is controversial because, mostly depending on the stage of the tumor, it may either suppress or support the disease. While autophagy delays the onset of tumors and slows the dissemination of cancer in the early stages of tumorigenesis, numerous studies demonstrate that autophagy promotes the development and spread of tumors as well as the evolution and development of resistance to several anticancer drugs in advanced cancer stages. In this Review, we primarily emphasize the therapeutic role of autophagy inhibition in improving the treatment of multiple cancers and give a broad overview of how its inhibition modulates cancer responses. There have been various attempts to inhibit autophagy, including the use of autophagy inhibitor drugs, gene silencing therapy (RNA interference), and nanoparticles. In this Review, all these topics are thoroughly covered and illustrated by recent studies and field investigations.

Rattle-structured nanoparticles with movable cores, porous shells and hollow interiors have shown great effectiveness in drug delivery and cancer theranostics. Targeting autophagy and glucose have provided alternative strategies for cancer intervention therapy. Herein, rattle-structured polydopamine@mesoporous silica nanoparticles were prepared for in vivo photoacoustic (PA) imaging and augmented low-temperature photothermal therapy (PTT) via complementary autophagy inhibition and glucose metabolism. Methods: The multifunctional rattle-structured nanoparticles were designed with the nanocore of PDA and the nanoshell of hollow mesoporous silica (PDA@hm) via a four-step process. PDA@hm was then loaded with autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and conjugated with glucose consumer glucose oxidase (GOx) (PDA@hm@CQ@GOx), forming a corona-like structure nanoparticle. Results: The CQ and GOx were loaded into the cavity and decorated onto the surface of PDA@hm, respectively. The GOx-mediated tumor starvation strategy would directly suppress the expression of HSP70 and HSP90, resulting in an enhanced low-temperature PTT induced by PDA nanocore. In addition, autophagy inhibition by the released CQ made up for the loss of low-temperature PTT and starvation efficiencies by PTT- and starvation-activated autophagy, realizing augmented therapy efficacy. Furthermore, the PDA nanocore in the PDA@hm@CQ@GOx could be also used for PA imaging. Conclusion: Such a “drugs” loaded rattle-structured nanoparticle could be used for augmented low-temperature PTT through complementarily regulating glucose metabolism and inhibiting autophagy and in vivo photoacoustic imaging.

Simple Summary BRAF is a protein kinase that is frequently mutationally activated in cancer. Mutant BRAF can be pharmacologically inhibited, which in combination with blockade of its direct effector, MEK1/2, is an FDA-approved therapeutic strategy for several BRAF-mutated cancer patients, such as melanoma, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, and thyroid cancer. However, therapy resistance is a major clinical challenge, highlighting the need for comprehensive investigations on the biological causes of such resistance, as well as to develop novel therapeutic strategies to improve patient survival. Autophagy is a cellular recycling process, which has been shown to allow cancer cells to escape from BRAF inhibition. Combined blockade of autophagy and BRAF signaling is a novel therapeutic strategy that is currently being tested in clinical trials. This review describes the relationship between BRAF-targeted therapy and autophagy regulation and discusses possible future treatment strategies. Abstract Several BRAF-driven cancers, including advanced BRAFV600E/K-driven melanoma, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, and thyroid cancer, are currently treated using first-line inhibitor combinations of BRAFV600E plus MEK1/2. However, despite the success of this vertical inhibition strategy, the durability of patient response is often limited by the phenomenon of primary or acquired drug resistance. It has recently been shown that autophagy, a conserved cellular recycling process, is increased in BRAF-driven melanoma upon inhibition of BRAFV600E signaling. Autophagy is believed to promote tumor progression of established tumors and also to protect cancer cells from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy. To this end, BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi)-resistant cells often display increased autophagy compared to responsive lines. Several mechanisms have been proposed for BRAFi-induced autophagy, such as activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress gatekeeper GRP78, AMP-activated protein kinase, and transcriptional regulation of the autophagy regulating transcription factors TFEB and TFE3 via ERK1/2 or mTOR inhibition. This review describes the relationship between BRAF-targeted therapy and autophagy regulation, and discusses possible future treatment strategies of combined inhibition of oncogenic signaling plus autophagy for BRAF-driven cancers.

Strategies to overcome resistance to FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-targeted therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are urgently needed. We identified autophagy as one of the resistance mechanisms, induced by hypoxia and the bone marrow microenvironment via activation of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). Suppressing autophagy/BTK sensitized FLT3-mutated AML to FLT3 inhibitor-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, co-targeting FLT3/BTK/aurora kinases with a novel multi-kinase inhibitor CG-806 (luxeptinib) induced profound apoptosis in FLT3-mutated AML by co-suppressing FLT3/BTK, antagonizing autophagy, and causing leukemia cell death in FLT3-wildtype AML by aurora kinase-mediated G2/M arrest and polyploidy, in addition to FLT3 inhibition. Thus, CG-806 exerted profound anti-leukemia activity against AML regardless of FLT3 mutation status. CG-806 also significantly reduced AML burden and extended survival in an in vivo patient-derived xenograft leukemia murine model of FLT3 inhibitor-resistant FLT3-ITD/TKD double-mutant primary AML. Taken together, these findings indicate that CG-806 has a unique mechanistic action and pre-clinical activity, which is presently undergoing clinical evaluation in both FLT3 wildtype and mutant AML.

ABSTRACT Macroautophagy/autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved pathway responsible for clearing cytosolic aggregated proteins, damaged organelles or invading microorganisms. Dysfunctional autophagy leads to pathological accumulation of the cargo, which has been linked to a range of human diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, infectious and autoimmune diseases and various forms of cancer. Cumulative work in animal models, application of genetic tools and pharmacologically active compounds, has suggested the potential therapeutic value of autophagy modulation in disease, as diverse as Huntington, Salmonella infection, or pancreatic cancer. Autophagy activation versus inhibition strategies are being explored, while the role of autophagy in pathophysiology is being studied in parallel. However, the progress of preclinical and clinical development of autophagy modulators has been greatly hampered by the paucity of selective pharmacological agents and biomarkers to dissect their precise impact on various forms of autophagy and cellular responses. Here, we summarize established and new strategies in autophagy-related drug discovery and indicate a path toward establishing a more efficient discovery of autophagy-selective pharmacological agents. With this knowledge at hand, modern concepts for therapeutic exploitation of autophagy might become more plausible.

ABSTRACT DBI/ACBP (diazepam binding inhibitor, also known as acyl coenzyme A binding protein), acts as a paracrine inhibitor of macroautophagy/autophagy. We characterized a monoclonal antibody neutralizing mouse DBI/ACBP (a-DBI) for its cytoprotective effects on several organs (heart, liver and lung) that were damaged by surgical procedures (ligation of coronary and hepatic arteries or bile duct ligation), a variety of different toxins (acetaminophen, bleomycin, carbon tetrachloride or concanavalin A) or a methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD). In all these models of organ damage, a-DBI prevents cell loss, inflammation and fibrosis through pathways that are blocked by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of autophagy. The hepatoprotective effects of a-DBI against MCD are mimicked by three alternative strategies to block DBI/ACBP signaling, in particular (i) induction of DBI/ACBP-specific autoantibodies, (ii) tamoxifen-inducible knockout of the Dbi gene, and (iii) a point mutation in Gabrg2 (gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor, subunit gamma 2; Gabrg2 F77I) that abolishes binding of DBI/ACBP. We conclude that a-DBI-mediated neutralization of extracellular DBI/ACBP mediates potent autophagy-dependent organ protection by on-target effects, hence unraveling a novel and potentially useful strategy for autophagy enhancement. “Autophagy checkpoint inhibition” can be achieved by targeting DBI/ACBP.

The induction of autophagy in cancer cells would occur in response to several therapy strategies, including chemotherapy and photothermal therapy (PTT). Hence, combined autophagy inhibition has been regarded as a prevailing strategy to enhance treatment sensitivity in cancers. Herein, dual pH/thermal responsive biomineralized nanocomposites (PCNPs) were rationally designed and prepared based on the hierarchical assembly of calcium phosphate (CaP) and polydopamine (PDA). The first step in the self-assembly process involves the incorporation of hydrophobic chemotherapeutic docetaxel (DTX) into the CaP nanoparticles. Next, PDA was utilized as the coating to hierarchically self-assemble onto the surface of CaP through a simple self-polymerization of dopamine. Third, the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) was absorbed onto the surface of PDA via non-covalent interactions, forming PCNPs/DC. CQ was the only FDA approved autophagy inhibitor in clinical trials that could inhibit autophagosome fusion and degradation. The resulting PCNPs/DC could exhibit dual pH/thermal responsive properties due to the acid-sensitive CaP core and the photothermal effect of the PDA coating. Effective inhibition of autophagy in cancer cells could be realized by blocking the lysosome and weakening the degradation of autolysosomes by PCNPs/DC. Interestingly, complementary autophagy inhibition could therefore sensitize the effects of chemo-photothermal therapy both in vitro and in vivo with negligible toxicity. Therefore, these hierarchically assembled biomineralized nanocomposites would be used as a prevailing strategy to sensitize chemo-photothermal therapy by complementary autophagy inhibition.

The aggressive nature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) mandates the development of improved therapies. Since KRAS mutations are found in 95% of PDAC and are critical for tumor maintenance, one promising strategy involves exploiting KRAS-dependent metabolic perturbations. The macrometabolic process of autophagy is upregulated in KRAS-mutant PDAC, and PDAC growth is reliant on autophagy. However, inhibition of autophagy as monotherapy using the lysosomal inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has shown limited clinical efficacy. To identify strategies that can improve PDAC sensitivity to HCQ, we applied a CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen and found that a top sensitizer was the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R). Additionally, RPPA pathway activation mapping profiled the signaling pathways altered by CQ treatment. Activating phosphorylation of RTKs, including IGF1R, were common compensatory increases in response to CQ. Inhibition of IGF1R increased autophagic flux and sensitivity to CQ-mediated growth suppression both in vitro and in vivo. Co-targeting both IGF1R and pathways that antagonize autophagy, such as ERK-MAPK axis, was strongly synergistic. IGF1R and ERK inhibition converged on suppression of glycolysis, leading to enhanced dependence on autophagy. Accordingly, concurrent inhibition of IGF1R, ERK, and autophagy induced cytotoxicity in PDAC cell lines, and decreased viability in human PDAC organoids. In conclusion, targeting IGF1R together with ERK enhances the effectiveness of autophagy inhibitors in PDAC.

Kinase inhibitors are effective cancer therapies, but tumors frequently develop resistance. Current strategies to circumvent resistance target the same or parallel pathways. We report here that targeting a completely different process, autophagy, can overcome multiple BRAF inhibitor resistance mechanisms in brain tumors. BRAFV600Emutations occur in many pediatric brain tumors. We previously reported that these tumors are autophagy-dependent and a patient was successfully treated with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine after failure of the BRAFV600E inhibitor vemurafenib, suggesting autophagy inhibition overcame the kinase inhibitor resistance. We tested this hypothesis in vemurafenib-resistant brain tumors. Genetic and pharmacological autophagy inhibition overcame molecularly distinct resistance mechanisms, inhibited tumor cell growth, and increased cell death. Patients with resistance had favorable clinical responses when chloroquine was added to vemurafenib. This provides a fundamentally different strategy to circumvent multiple mechanisms of kinase inhibitor resistance that could be rapidly tested in clinical trials in patients with BRAFV600E brain tumors.
