Autophagy is a self-destructive cellular process that removes essential metabolites and waste from inside the cell to maintain cellular health. Mitophagy is the process by which autophagy causes disruption inside mitochondria and the total removal of damaged or stressed mitochondria, hence enhancing cellular health. The mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, performing essential functions such as ATP (adenosine triphosphate) generation, metabolism, Ca2+ buffering, and signal transduction. Many different mechanisms, including endosomal and autophagosomal transport, bring these substrates to lysosomes for processing. Autophagy and endocytic processes each have distinct compartments, and they interact dynamically with one another to complete digestion. Since mitophagy is essential for maintaining cellular health and using genetics, cell biology, and proteomics techniques, it is necessary to understand its beginning, particularly in ubiquitin and receptor-dependent signalling in injured mitochondria. Despite their similar symptoms and emerging genetic foundations, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have all been linked to abnormalities in autophagy and endolysosomal pathways associated with neuronal dysfunction. Mitophagy is responsible for normal mitochondrial turnover and, under certain physiological or pathological situations, may drive the elimination of faulty mitochondria. Due to their high energy requirements and post-mitotic origin, neurons are especially susceptible to autophagic and mitochondrial malfunction. This article focused on the importance of autophagy and mitophagy in neurodegenerative illnesses and how they might be used to create novel therapeutic approaches for treating a wide range of neurological disorders.

Cellular communication processes are highly dynamic and mediated, at least in part, by contacts between various membrane structures. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the major biosynthetic organelle of the cell, establishes an extensive network with other membrane structures to regulate the transport of intracellular molecules. Vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1), an ER-localized metazoan-specific protein, plays important roles in the formation of autophagosomes and communication between the ER and other organelles, including mitochondria, autophagosome precursor membranes, Golgi, lipid droplets, and endosomes. Increasing evidence has indicated that autophagy and ER–membrane communication at membrane contact sites are closely related to neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this review, we summarize the roles of VMP1 in autophagy and ER–membrane contacts and discuss their potential implications in neurodegenerative disorders.

The endoplasmic reticulum, a key cellular organelle, regulates a wide variety of cellular activities. Endoplasmic reticulum autophagy, one of the quality control systems of the endoplasmic reticulum, plays a pivotal role in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis by controlling endoplasmic reticulum turnover, remodeling, and proteostasis. In this review, we briefly describe the endoplasmic reticulum quality control system, and subsequently focus on the role of endoplasmic reticulum autophagy, emphasizing the spatial and temporal mechanisms underlying the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum autophagy according to cellular requirements. We also summarize the evidence relating to how defective or abnormal endoplasmic reticulum autophagy contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In summary, this review highlights the mechanisms associated with the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum autophagy and how they influence the pathophysiology of degenerative nerve disorders. This review would help researchers to understand the roles and regulatory mechanisms of endoplasmic reticulum-phagy in neurodegenerative disorders.
